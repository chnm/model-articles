On April 22, 1715, the marriage of Maria de Arruda Leite and João
Antunes Maciel was listed laconically in the parish books of Itu, a
small town in a frontier zone of colonial Brazil. The recording of the
wedding took just a few lines, using a customary template to state the
couple's and parents' names as well as to declare the administration of
the holy sacrament of matrimony.[^1] This formulaic act, repeated
thousands of times by priests in the Portuguese empire, reveals a sense
of ordinariness that permeated the union. The couple was born into
distinguished families that settled in the region during the 17^th^
century, engaging in the exploration of frontier resources. Bride and
groom grew up in the same nearby town and, coincidentally, moved with
their families to Itu a few years before the wedding. Most likely, they
knew each other quite well and the wedding was a much-awaited event in
the community.

The ceremony thus seemed an ordinary event in the daily affairs of the
town -- to the point that the absence of the groom could pass unnoticed
to the modern observer. On that day, João entered into wedlock by a
proxy appointed to act in his interest while he journeyed the backlands
of South America. Canon law and the regulations of the Catholic Church
in Brazil provided for the administration of a sacrament in absentia,
but this was reserved for extraordinary occasions and required the
approval of the diocese's archbishop, who lived more than a thousand
miles away. The lack of any indication in the marital record makes it
unlikely that the couple had an authorization of this sort, yet the
union was celebrated normally and confirmed by the birth of three
daughters in the following years.

Life stories like this, in which mobility and absence were everyday
imperatives, were not uncommon in this fringe of the Portuguese empire.
Itu was one of the few towns that the Luso-Brazilian settlers
established away from the coast before the 18^th^ century, in a small
cluster of inland settlements around the town of São Paulo. This
geographic setting deviated from a long-standing pattern of Portuguese
empire-building. Since the 15^th^ century, settlements established
overseas were confined to the littoral and integrated into the empire
through maritime routes.[^2] The one-hundred miles that separated Itu
from the nearest port was not overwhelming, but the orientation of these
settlements, contrary to the rest of the overseas domains, was towards
the vast interior of South America. These backlands provided the
necessary resources, such as indigenous labor and fertile soils, for the
survival of this small Portuguese enclave. Their extraction, however,
depended on spatial practices that made that environment amenable for
exploitation. To settle in this isolated region and cope with distance,
the inhabitants of São Paulo, such as João and Maria, responded with
continuous mobility.

This article follows the trajectories of the families of São Paulo to
trace their spatial practices during the interiorization of the
Portuguese colonization in Brazil, stressing the role of kinship in
sustaining the new territorial organization of the colony. Based on the
patterns of geographic mobility reconstituted through digital methods, I
argue that the sustained mobility of these colonists wove together an
otherwise fragmented territory. In faraway regions where infrastructure
was lacking and the grasp of the formal apparatus of the monarchy was
weak, the comings and goings of people like João and Maria produced
connections that linked settlements and afforded long-distance social
and economic exchanges. Ultimately, the constant mobility of these
colonists helped to integrate these new areas, especially after the
discovery of mineral deposits in central Brazil during the early 18^th^
century, into the rest of the empire.

The mobility of the people of São Paulo is the theme of an extensive
historiography focusing on the *bandeirismo*. Nineteenth-century
historians initiated a trend of studies that emphasized the mobility of
this socio-spatial group, focusing on their expeditions into the
backlands in the two first centuries of colonization. This literature
reached its apex in the early 20^th^ century, when São Paulo was going
through a rapid process of industrialization. Mostly, they produced
stories that singled out expeditions and their leaders -- dubbed the
"bandeirantes" -- composing a narrative of pioneering and
nation-building.[^3] In dialogue with this tradition, the seminal work
of Sergio Buarque de Holanda depicted this mobile population as the
synthesis (cultural and biological) of Portuguese and Indians,
representing a new type engendered by colonization.[^4] Since the 1980s,
historians have questioned the epic narrative and its nativist overtones
by connecting the mobility of Luso-Brazilians with the social and
economic context of Portuguese colonization as well as, in recent
contributions, expanding the notion of *bandeirismo* to other areas and
periods.[^5]

While, for them, the wayfaring in the backlands was a defining
characteristic of colonial São Paulo, other scholars depicted the
geographic mobility of Luso-Brazilian colonists as exceptional. In this
strand of literature, journeying the backlands was the only resource
available for the impoverished and the marginalized. Not only was São
Paulo a poor frontier that lacked economic alternatives other than
relying on the resources of the backlands, but the people who adventured
the interior were described as socially stigmatized. The precariousness
of the itinerancy marked their lives.[^6] Mobility thus meant leaving
their social world behind and was a symptom of intentional or socially
driven up-rootedness. Collectively, the wayfaring of these individuals
contributed to the frantic, chaotic settlement of the interior spurred
by the "gold rush" in the early 18^th^ century.[^7]

This article connects both historiographical traditions by revealing the
continuation of spatial practices between the 17^th^ and 18^th^
centuries and overcoming the regional emphasis of the recent literature.
As most of these studies focused on specific regions, the wayfaring was
perceived more in terms of structuring local communities than shaping
the spatial organization of the empire. Moreover, the centrality of
family in shaping the ebb and flow of people in the backlands also
challenges the idea of a disorderly gold rush. Family provided social
and economic means of traveling and settling in remote areas as well as
a way of remaining socially and economically connected to the rest of
the empire.

The spatial practices of the inhabitants of São Paulo did not go
unchanged during colonization. In the 17^th^ century, this wayfaring
created a repertoire of knowledge, including geographical information
(topography, hydrography, rudimentary infrastructure of trails, location
of indigenous groups) and techniques of movement and survival, that
allowed them to thrive in the harsh environment of the backlands. This
knowledge was reproduced and nurtured within the family. Parents raised
their male children to partake in these expeditions and strove to
attract experienced men to their ranks to assist in family enterprises.
In the final decades of that century, under crown's incentives,
explorers redeployed what they knew about the backlands to the search of
precious minerals. Kinsfolk organized new expeditions and traveled to
regions where their relatives had been raiding Indians for decades, but
with a novel intent of mineral prospecting. For example, while João
appointed an agent to take the marital vows in his name, he was with his
relatives in the uncolonized Mato Grosso in search of gold.

Once discoveries were made and encampments created, these new pockets of
Portuguese settlement inland relied on the stock of family members to
survive, grow, and flourish. The first Luso-Brazilian settlers in the
backlands reached out to their kinsfolk, encouraging them to move to
these new areas. Furthermore, migrants favored places where their
relatives had gone before and where their family kept connections and
alliances. João and Maria's household is exemplary in this respect.
After the discovery of gold in Mato Grosso, the absent newlywed and his
kinsfolk settled in the faraway town of Cuiabá, paving the way for new
migratory waves. Maria moved to live with her husband sometime after the
wedding, and the couple raised their daughters in this remote canton.

Nevertheless, this is not a one-way story -- of settlers merely pushing
the frontier westward. As they moved deeper inland, they strove to keep
ties with kin, friends, and allies in their former places of residence.
Quite often, settlers and their descendants repeated the same journeys
in the opposite direction, returning to the town where their family was
originally established after spending several years in advanced posts in
the backlands. For instance, João and Maria's three daughters returned
to Itu to marry. Most likely, they spent the rest of their lives there.
Even though they were away for many years, the family headed by João and
Maria cultivated social ties to the region in which they once lived,
making the return of the daughters effortless. Moreover, relatives had
property and investments spread between former and current hometowns,
and they moved between places or appointed agents to manage businesses.
The reiteration of these journeys consolidated the connections of
locations set apart by gargantuan distances.

In this sense, the spatial practices that "connected the dots" of a
fragmented territory developed in the highlands of São Paulo in the
17^th^ century were extended on a much larger geographic scale during
the first decades of the following century. They brokered the
unsurmountable distances that hampered the consolidation of the
Portuguese empire in the Americas. Kinship-based mobility offered a
mechanism to occupy large stretches of land, even when the imperial
grasp was weak and in a territorial configuration that, though inland,
remained rather insular. The mobility of the people of São Paulo,
notably the repetition of the journeys between the same locations over
time, reinforced the ties that bound together distant places, favoring
the circulation of information, people, and goods and granting a
dispersed geography a sense of cohesion and integration. The intangible
infrastructure it created impersonated the spatial configuration of the
Portuguese empire in the backlands. In sum, the peopling of the
backlands was not a disorderly "gold rush," but a relatively organized
expansion based on forms of mobility structured by family relationships.
For these settlers, the backlands were not an undistinguished interior
-- as the term *sertão* and its correlates (wilderness, frontier) might
suggest -- but a set of specific locations traveled by their relatives
for generations.

{{% notation title="On Digital Methods" %}}

This article relies heavily on what has been generically described as “digital methods.” Although the term itself isn’t very descriptive, it serves to indicate that the central evidence discussed in the text was systematically produced, analyzed, and represented using computational tools. The research was a multi-step process and required a combination of different tools and techniques. In the process of creating the dataset, I used optical character recognition (OCR) to generate raw data, custom-written Python code to parse and extract information, a front-end web interface for manual revision, and a relational database (MySQL) to organize and store the data. The database format allowed different types of queries, from browsing records of the family of an individual to quantitative analysis, which were essential for writing this article. Lastly, GIS mapping was also crucial to analyze and create visualizations that support the argument of the paper.

The term “digital methods” covers all these different steps, which was the most time-consuming part of the project. Individually, however, each of these parts –except for GIS mapping – was a very ordinary way of handling data. (There are some noteworthy insights, though. For example, the computational techniques I used allowed me to “read” a book differently, such as connecting parts of the genealogies that were scattered across the different volumes of the book.) In this sense, they don’t constitute as a standalone method. Moreover, their reproducibility is also questionable. While genealogical data is widely available for many places and periods, I used a very specific set of materials that was intimately associated with the research question I was investigating. A detailed account of the process of creating the dataset, which is common in digital humanities articles, thus seemed less important than focus on the historiographical contribution I intended to make.

Therefore, I decided to write this text as a regular historiographical essay and include methodological information sparingly. My rule of thumb was to have the minimal amount of methodological discussion to make my evidence understandable and support my claims. I attempted to inform the reader very briefly about the data I presented and how I was interpreting it. In this sense, the digital methods that I used lie in the background of the text.
This choice raised two issues. First, the flexibility of the database in reorganizing the data in different always allowed me to repurpose pieces of evidence as the argument developed. On the other hand, it also demanded that, throughout the text, I explained these slightly different versions of the presented data. It was hard not to overburden the reader sometimes, especially in the last part of the text. It also limited the length I had to discuss how I was interpreting that particular piece of evidence. Second, hard-to-acquire data might seem deceptively trivial in some cases. When I make a statement like “X descendants of an explorer ended up settling in the place he discovered,” the amount of work and tinkering to produce that small bit of information is obscured. Often, it required a lot of fiddling with the dataset to find the best records to make a point.

Still, writing this paper wouldn’t be possible without these methods, as I discuss in these annotations. The hardest part to communicate, however, is how the practice of doing digital humanities deeply informed the understanding of the research object and shaped the argument of the article. These digital methods not only produced analyzable data but also created an environment and offered tools to “play” with the source material.

Foremost, building this dataset, which was the starting point of this article, was a way of thinking through the source material. It was like taking apart and rebuilding, in a novel and purposeful way, a toy. On the surface, the research begins with a dataset that “replicates” the original object (the genealogical writings.) However, the process of disassembling these genealogical writings and reassembling them digitally transformed my understanding of its content and structure. For example, the idea of a pattern of multi-generational circular mobility –  of “returnees” that were born in new inland towns that came back to their parent’s hometown – came after revising dozens of records in which siblings married in the same town. It wasn’t a prior hypothesis tested through quantification, but an argument developed through the painstaking work of handling the dataset. They were the results of the experience of working with the genealogical writings through various digital methods. None of these questions would be part of a methodological section of an article.

{{% /notation %}}

This article is the result of a novel way of reading traditional sources
using digital methods. For generations, genealogists have recorded
information about the lives of the inhabitants of São Paulo. Most of the
writings were sparse, usually focusing on the genealogists' family
history, but three comprehensive efforts to record the lineages of São
Paulo have been published in the past two centuries. These writings
weave together individual vignettes -- in most cases, no longer than a
handful of lines containing some of the known dates and places of birth,
marriage, and death -- with the set of familial relationships. In this
study, the former allows the locating of historical agents in space and
time and, from there, the delineation of broad patterns of behavior; the
latter permits the reconstitution of the convoluted fabric of kinship
that bound that society together.

{{% notation title="About Sources" %}}
Digital history projects generate a massive amount of data that could be used in several ways. A challenge in writing this article was to decide what should be included or not. The first draft of this article had a 12-page section on genealogical writing in São Paulo and the process of transforming it into a database. As the argument evolved, I decided to suppress the entire section as the main point of the text wasn’t about the genealogies, but the spatial practices of the people whose lives were narrated in it.

An overview of the dataset

Genealogical compilations about the people of São Paulo exists since the late 18th century when Pedro Taques de Almeida Paes Leme – whose a short biography appears towards the end of the article – began to gather information about their fellow countrypeople. He produced a few dozen manuscripts (collectively entitled Nobiliarchia Paulistana) that were posthumously published in the mid 19th century. This initial compilation served as the basis of a new publication – Silva Leme’s Genealogia Paulistana – whose 9 volumes were published between 1903 and 1905. Throughout the 20th century, several individual researchers criticized, revised, and made amendments to Silva Leme’s work. In 2002, Marta Amato compiled several of these corrections and additions and published a new version of the Genealogia Paulistana with three extra volumes.

Amato’s publication was the basis for the dataset analyzed in this research. It contains 70,000+ individual entries of people organized in a descending numbering system starting from a progenitor (an “original” Luso-Brazilian colonist of São Paulo.) I was able to place 28,849 of these life stories in the 18th century or before. From this subset, I then identified 2,948 whose records indicated places of birth and marriage and used this information to trace their mobility. Figures 3 to 5 are visual representations of this data. In addition, some different forms of selection – like including places of death – complemented the evidence analyzed in the text.

Demographic data is scant for colonial Brazil, so it is impossible to determine the size of the selection in comparison to the total population. Some estimates are possible, though. For 1687, when there were around 15,400 parishioners (based on the number of people that confessed) in the captaincy of São Paulo, the dataset listed 4,209 people that were alive. If we consider who was over twelve years old (2,848), it would mean that the dataset covers about 18% of the entire population living in the Luso-Brazilian settlements in the captaincy at that point in time. 

Gender distribution, assigned based on first names, slightly favors women (1:0.97 female-to-male ratio), but they tend to have less information than their male counterparts. On average, the records of males were 173 characters long, while women’s were 156. Very long, detailed records were rare, but were vastly male. One can also assume that, due to the nature of the genealogical enterprises, the top sector of São Paulo society is overrepresented in the dataset.

{{% /notation %}}

This study is based on a relational database of more than 30,000 entries
about individuals that lived in São Paulo or its area of expansion
between the 16^th^ and 18^th^ centuries. The textual records were parsed
to extract information about the individuals' lives while the textual
structure of the genealogies, which reproduced family relationships,
were preserved in the digital medium. The transformation of these
writings into networked data removed the linearity imposed by the
structure of the text, allowing extensive manipulation of the web of
family ties. Individual stories of wayfaring and mobility thus could be
read alongside those of siblings, cousins, in-laws, and other relatives
that helped to define where people ended up settling and carrying on
with their lives. Moreover, linked data also helped to mitigate the
constraints of an extraordinarily fragmentary and incomplete corpus.
This approach allowed the description of broad patterns of mobility
across long periods as well as browsing through specific exemplary
cases.

A Society on the Move
=====================

By the time of its foundation in the mid-16^th^ century, São Paulo was
the only Portuguese town in the Americas away from the Atlantic Ocean,
contrasting with a century-old pattern of empire-building. From its
inception in the early 15^th^ century to the turn of the 17^th^ century,
the Portuguese presence overseas was limited to scattered coastal
settlements on the seaboard of Africa, Asia, and South America. These
locations -- a diversified set of trading factories, fortresses, and
port cities -- were points of contact between Europeans with other
states, empires, and merchant communities that formed long-distance
commercial networks. Through these channels, European traders supplied
their continent with a variety of exotic commodities, such as spices,
gold, and brazilwood, as well as granted territorial access to the
proselytizing mission of Catholic missionaries. The Portuguese used
their naval power to control, though not uncontested, a series of
coastal settlements and maritime routes connecting these exclaves to
Lisbon, turning the capital city into a vital entrepôt between Europe
and other places around the globe.[^8]

{{% notation title="Augmentation Techniques" %}}
Because of my option of limiting methodological discussions, I had to leave many small but interesting methodological interventions out of the text. The augmentation techniques were one of them. For instance, I leverage the fact the units of my dataset – the individuals that were part of the most prominent families of São Paulo during the colonial era – were connected to each other to identify and complement potential gaps. For people whose records didn’t indicate any dates, I used siblings’ information to place that person in large temporal units (blocks of 50 years.) That complemented several observations in the dataset and turned them “analyzable” by the other methods of the research.

I also connected families that, because of the linear structure of the text, were in different parts of the Genealogia Paulistana. (For instance, family A has a record of X marrying to Y, and family B has another one of Y marrying X.) This technique allowed me to observe the importance of in-laws, as already pointed out by the historiography, is making cohesive the dispersed geography of colonial Brazil.

Because I wasn’t explicitly discussing then, I decided to take a conservative approach and only adopt procedures that I judged to be uncontroversial. Nevertheless, it is possible to expand the dataset in many ways – for instance, adding to the parent’s place list, the location of their children’s birth. Nevertheless, that would require more extensive discussion, and I opted to leave it out this article.
{{% /notation %}}

In Brazil, the physical and human geography of the territory favored
this mode of empire-building. The Serra do Mar, a system of mountains
and escarpments that stretches for more than 1,000 miles along the coast
between latitudes 20^o^ and 26^o^ S, delineated a long but thin strip of
land easily accessible to colonists. Reaching the interior, however, was
hindered by the natural barrier that, at some places, was as high as
7,000 feet tall and covered in lush tropical rainforests.[^9] The
dichotomy between littoral and interior also marked European perceptions
of the indigenous groups. While along the coast, the Portuguese mostly
encountered a relatively homogenous linguistic group, the Tupi, but the
interior was inhabited by the Tapuia -- a generic designation for
non-Tupi people -- who were depicted as ferocious, backward, and nomad
groups.[^10]

{{% notation title="The Simple Map" %}}
A feedback I frequently received in writing this article, including from one of the reviewers, was to include a “simple map” giving an overview of the studied areas and showing the places I mentioned in the text. As it is a common practice among historians, especially those that don’t focus on “central” places – nobody asks for a map to show we Paris is – the absence of such a map causes discomfort and disorientation among the readers.

Not having this simple map was an intentional choice for several reasons. My work attempts to understand how space is historically produced and, thus, liable to changes over time and explainable through temporal analysis. Giving such a static representation of this space, especially when the article covers a long period, would contradict this conceptual framework. It would also mislead the reader to believe that a well-ordered space actually existed. This choice is also supported by debates on information design and among historians who use of visualizations, which defend that visualization should further arguments. That is, visualizations articulate a set of evidence to demonstrate something to the reader.  A “simple map” – which would offer a stagnant depiction of colonial Brazil – would undermine the article’s argument.

The use of the basic map also raises issues specific to my research. First, it would ascribe a top-down, grided territoriality that was alien to the historical agents discussed in the article. A 17th-century Luso-Brazilian colonist had a very different perception of space than of the aerial view of a modern map. Second, that map would emphasize the linear distance between settlements as a central explanatory variable. Indeed, distance, especially when measured using contemporary standards (such as day’s travel instead of miles), are an essential piece of any analysis that centers on space. However, the underlying argument of the paper is that, in shaping the mobility of the inhabitants of São Paulo, the distance or availability of infrastructure mattered less than the social relation and kinship networks established across locations.

Still, the discomfort caused by this absence remains, and I took two measures to mitigate the disorientation of the readers. First, I tried to dilute the information that would exist in the basic map into the existing visualizations. Second, in the revised version, I opted to openly confront this problem. I made explicit the choice of not having the map and try to use that as an opportunity to discuss the theoretical underpinnings of my work and how they manifest in the structure and choices of the article.

In the first two centuries of colonization, the extent of the Portuguese
empire in South America barely stretched a few miles away from the sea.
The Portuguese, in the words of contemporary writer Vicente de Salvador,
"although great conquerors of lands, do not take advantage of them but
are content to move along the seacoast scratching at them like
crabs."[^11]

The foundation of São Paulo, an inland town a dozen miles to the west of
Serra do Mar, deviated from this mode of spatial organization. Close to
the latitude of São Vicente, the first town founded by the Portuguese in
the Americas, the strip of land between the mountain range and the
Atlantic Ocean narrows but presents more accessible passes through the
rugged terrain.[^12] Leaving São Vicente Island, Portuguese settlers
followed the Cubatão River upstream until reaching the foothills of the
Paranapiacaba Mountain, where Jesuit missionary José de Anchieta led the
opening of a tortuous trail through the escarpment. Chronicler Simão de
Vasconcelos, another Jesuit, in a recollection of his journey through
the route in the mid-17^th^ century, noted:

> I was shocked by the roughness of the trail, considering that it was
> the easier path through these mountains. There were parts where we had
> to climb with feet and hands hooked into the roots of the trees; there
> were parts with ridges and cliffs that made us afraid of looking down,
> and when we reached the summit of a hill, we found ourselves in the
> foot of another.[^13]

After overcoming the mountains, the precarious, winding trail through
the tropical rainforest ended up in a clearing where colonists settled
near a Tupiniquim village. In 1560, this initial settlement, with its
hybrid population of Portuguese and Indians, was relocated to a nearby,
better-protected hill where the Jesuits had already founded a mission
village, giving birth to the town of São Paulo. The site of the new
town, as a colonial governor recollected, "was in the edges of a
slightly inclined circular plateau and rules over, in one direction, as
far as the sight could reach and, on the other, the multitude of
gigantic mountains that form the horizon."[^14] The stark contrast
between an impeding topography on one side and an inviting flatland on
the other favored the engagement of the inhabitants of colonial São
Paulo with this perceived boundless frontier as well as shaped their
patterns of mobility.

This visualization gives a brief overview of the process of territorial expansion of the Portuguese colonization in Brazil. Because I used a comprehensive dataset of towns and cities, it included many places that weren’t part of my narrative. They could mislead the reader, though. For example, what appears to be the most dynamic area of expansion – the string-like network of new towns along the Amazon river in the second half of the 18th century – isn’t centrally related to the process I’m describing. (For an excellent analysis of this subject, see Heather Roller’s Amazonian Routes.) Instead of arbitrarily select points that would demonstrate my argument, I indicated in the captions that aspects I wanted to emphasize in the visualizations and then discuss them in the text. This is becoming standard practice in DH articles, although many readers still just skim through the images and captions.

As pointed out by the extensive literature, the backlands of South
America provided the inhabitants of São Paulo with critical resources --
land and labor -- for the development of their settlements. The ways
through which these resources were transformed into private property, as
argued by Metcalf, marked the social formation of Luso-Brazilian
communities in the region.[^15] This process, however, relied on spatial
practices specific to the backlands. As an unknown set of environs, the
interior of South America posed challenges that were slowly overcome by
the people in the fringes of the empire. By venturing into the interior
in search of land and labor throughout the 17^th^ century,
Luso-Brazilians living far from the center of the empire grew accustomed
to the harshness of these environments.

First, the highlands of São Paulo presented colonists with an abundant
supply of land, which was exploited through the adoption of indigenous
techniques of cultivation. Known as *coivara* or *roça-de-toco* -- and,
in modern times, slash-and-burn, swidden, and itinerant agriculture --
this farming technique was based on the use of fire to clear tracts of
forest and fertilize the terrain. Through burning, plots were ridden of
major obstructions and invasive species, ashes fertilized the soil, and
seeding could be done with nothing more than digging sticks. Initially,
the land was very productive, but yields plummeted after three or four
seasons due to the absence of other forms of fertilization. In addition,
invasive species reappeared quickly in a terrain now free of competition
and natural predators, increasing labor requirements. As colonists
perceived the supply of land as unlimited and virtually free, the
solution for land depletion was to move, after farming in the same place
for a few years, to new areas with dense vegetation and restart the
process. Degraded plots were left to their fate, to fallow. In many
cases, secondary forest regrew after a few decades, but a continuous
cycle of burning and resting definitively transformed the tropical
forest into grassland, which was often repurposed to meet the needs of a
growing livestock economy.[^16]

As colonists had to search for new tracts of forest, they moved further
into the backlands, extending the area of Portuguese occupation. Often,
farming grounds were located miles away from urban centers, and
colonists would spend most of their time interned in remote areas.
Eventually, as suggested by historian Sergio Buarque de Holanda, this
spatial dynamic triggered the creation of new urban cores as colonists
became too distant from their hometowns. When that happened,
Luso-Brazilian colonists gathered together to found new settlements,
organize their institutional apparatus, and resume religious services
and social life. During the 17^th^ century, São Vicente was the
captaincy with the highest number of new settlements, gaining nine new
towns inland (and only three along the coast.) They remained relatively
small, as the creation of new settlements meant a demographic decrease
in older towns but allowed the empire to extend itself to a large area
in the interior even with meager population growth.[^17]

Similarly, labor was also a product of the frontier, and its primary
mechanism of production, slaving expeditions, also made the inhabitants
of São Paulo invested in the backlands. The labor requirements of the
region were met largely by the native population, upon whom colonists
placed an increasing pressure. Indian slaves toiled the land, worked as
servants and in a broad array of menial jobs, participated in Portuguese
warfare, and had a pivotal role, as carriers, in sustaining the
commercial links of the towns in the highlands of São Paulo with the
coast.

Early on, missionaries undertook efforts to control native labor by
creating mission villages (*aldeamentos*) in the highlands where they
assembled and converted dispersed indigenous groups and rented their
work to Luso-Brazilian colonists through a system of contract labor.
This model, however, failed to provide a stable solution for the
emerging Luso-Brazilian settlements, and colonists took upon themselves
the task of producing a workforce.[^18] They thus began to outfit
expeditions, known as *bandeiras* and *armações*, to enter the backlands
and enslave indigenous populations. Initially, these raids centered in
the areas around São Paulo, but, with the dwindling of native
populations close to the colonial settlements, expeditions increased the
distances they traveled.

In the first half of the 17^th^ century, parties departing from São
Paulo developed maritime, riverine, and land itineraries to many areas
in South America. A profitable slaving route was to the "sertão dos
Carijós," where priests founded several mission villages under the
Jesuit Province of Guairá. Although the trip to the region took more
than two weeks, it rapidly became the target of many assaults. By 1632,
contemporary sources estimate that between 30,000 and 60,000 Indians
were brought from this region to São Paulo, forcing Jesuits and Indians
to relocate their settlements to the south, where the slavers
encountered stiffer resistance of militarized mission-villages.[^19]
From the 1640s onwards, slaving expeditions diversified and reached many
regions in South America that were still barely touched by Europeans.
For instance, a famous party led by Antonio Raposo Tavares, a veteran
leader of the raids in the Guairá, made a long tour through the Amazon
after an unsuccessful assault against mission-villages in northern
Paraguay. After three years of wandering astray, Tavares and the
surviving crew ended up in the city of Pará, in northern Brazil,
thousands of miles away from São Paulo.[^20]

The organization of these expeditions was largely a family activity.
Relatives, friends, and allies partnered to raise funds, gather
resources, exchange information about the interior, and reallocate
Indians in their possession to act as guides and porters.[^21] Since
capital investments were low -- explorers packed just a few items, such
as firearms, gunpowder, and hammocks, and lived from what they gathered
and hunted -- the most valued resource was experienced Luso-Brazilian
men who could join these enterprises. Families invested heavily to
increase the number of people that could contribute to these
expeditions. Male children accompanied their fathers and relatives in
the backlands as part of their training and coming of age, in the hopes
that they would learn the techniques and knowledge necessary to survive
in the backlands and eventually lead expeditions on their own.[^22]
Moreover, Portuguese inheritance laws, which mandated the equal
distribution of the deceased's property among children and thus created
a tendency of downward mobility, also contributed to increasing the
pressure over the offspring to adventure the interior and incorporate
new resources into the family's pool. Lastly, relatives who stayed,
including women, also supported these expeditions by taking care of the
family's business during the absence of the travelers or by helping the
parties from afar.

In a rare glimpse of the daily affairs of one of these expeditions, when
a participant died and left the inventory of his property, it is
possible to see the extensive, if not convoluted, way in which kinship
made wayfaring possible. On June 28, 1645, a fatally ill explorer,
Antonio Gomes Borba, summoned his colleague Francisco Bicudo Fernandes
to write his will. Borba lived in the frontier town of Santana do
Parnaíba with his wife and daughter, but his surname was a constant
reminder of his birthplace in Portugal. It is unclear when he moved to
Brazil, but it is certain that, once there, he strove to forge alliances
with local families that eventually led him to be part of that
expedition. The choices Borba made on his deathbed (or death-hammock)
reveal the strength of these relationships. He appointed Antônio Pedroso
de Alvarenga, his companion in the expeditions, as the curator of his
daughter's property. In fact, Alvarenga was already the godfather of
Borba's daughter, and both men were long-standing business partners. (As
noted in the will, the only debtor that the wounded Portuguese men
remembered was Alvarenga's father, who owed Borba 4.5 tons of wheat.)

After Borba's death, the personal belongings he had brought to the
backlands were auctioned among the members of the expedition, revealing
the names of other participants. In fact, Borba represented the end of
the chain of familial relationships -- in his case, through the
fictional though nonetheless indispensable kinship through godparentage
-- that sustained that *armação*. Borba's closest allies, the
Alvarengas, probably helped him to breach the social fabric of the
highlands of São Paulo, granting him access to a larger pool of
potential partners. Not only was the younger Alvarenga related through a
marital alliance to the will's scribe, but two of his brothers-in-law
(João and Antônio Bicudo de Brito) appeared among the members of the
expedition as well. A fourth cousin-in-law, Cristovão Aguiar Girão, also
accompanied them into the backlands. Besides the relationships
reconstituted through the genealogical data, the other two members of
the expedition shared the surnames of the other participants and, most
likely, were young men wayfaring together with their kinsfolk. Girão,
for instance, was the guarantor of a certain Manoel Girão in the auction
of the deceased's property. Lastly, one of the leaders of the
expedition, Captain Francisco Siqueira, was related to this group
through marriage -- he was the stepfather of the writer of the will.

In all, this kin group included nine of the fifteen participants listed
in Borba's probate inventory. Besides Indians, who were silenced in this
documentation, there were probably other Luso-Brazilians in the
expedition, but the number of names listed in the record matches the
average size of a small expedition.[^23] Little is known about the other
few names that appear on the list. Even the expedition leader, João
Mendes Geraldo, did not receive extensive attention in the genealogical
records, besides the fact that he brought along his son, Miguel
Gonçalves Correia, to the backlands. Neither do we know about the
destination of the expedition. Most likely, they were headed to the
*sertão* of the Paraná River, where two of the party members had visited
on previous expeditions: Cristovão de Aguiar Girão visited the region in
1638 and Francisco de Siqueira in 1641.[^24]

The prevalence of in-laws journeying the backlands together also
exemplifies the role of marital alliances in forging these partnerships
and fostering mobility. In fact, the sizable dowries that the families
of São Paulo reserved for their daughters, as demonstrated by Nazzari,
were an attempt to recruit sons-in-law for the pool of specialized
labor. Parents significantly favored their daughters in disposing of
property, as dowries, considered an advance inheritance, far exceeded
the sons' share in the bequests. By doing so, parents expected that
their daughters' family would be able to set up a new production unit,
and her in-laws would become a potential partner for the slave raids in
the backlands.[^25]

Interestingly, these marriages increased the sense of spatial cohesion
among the dispersed constellation of small towns in the highlands of São
Paulo. The combination of the restrictions imposed by the diminished
number of potential spouses locally and the high premium in finding a
good match provided incentives to single men and women to search for
spouses outside town. The settlements around São Paulo were small, with
a few thousand residents at best, and did not offer many options of
spouses that matched social and racial status, kinship restrictions, and
affinity. However, if willing to search for a husband within a day-long
horseback ride (\~30 mi), a single woman would double the number of
unmarried males and potential spouses; the increase was threefold after
two days of travel. Furthermore, searching for spouses elsewhere would
offer other advantages. Besides enabling access to resources locally
bound to other towns, such as fresh tracts of land, marriages
established with outside residents increased the alliances and potential
partnerships that a family could forge.[^26]

Genealogical data for the second half of the 17^th^ century illustrates
this strategy of expanding the radius of the spousal search. Figure 3
indicates the dislocation between the place of birth and wedding (n=135)
and reveals the preference for partners born outside town. For spouses
born and married in the captaincy of São Vicente (115), 60% married
outside their birthplace, while the remainder preferred to find spouses
locally. In older towns, such as São Vicente, São Paulo, and Mogi das
Cruzes, the ratio of local to regional marriages was less than 1 -- that
is, more people married outside, in a nearby town -- while in newer
towns there is a clear preference for local matches. In these areas,
local marriages were at least twice (Itu) or three times (Sorocaba) as
common as regional ones, reinforcing the argument about the interest in
these colonists in the frontier zones. Older urban cores had potentially
less land available and thus exercised pressure for mobility; newer
zones of colonization unlocked unexplored pools of resources -- and
moving there increased their ability to explore them.

Marriages outside the captaincy, possibly because of the geographic
coverage of the dataset, were rather infrequent (3 cases), whereas the
number of Portuguese immigrants marrying local women was significant but
still small (18 cases). Interestingly, access to frontier resources to
these newcomers seemed to be hindered by their lack of local connections
as they settled in more consolidated cores. Most Portuguese men
(including two from the Azores) married in São Paulo or the coastal town
of São Vicente, while only two of them managed to find spouses in the
interiorized town of Itu. The data is also unclear about when the
movement happened -- in other words, if the mismatch between the place
of birth and marriage occurred before or was related to the union.
Nevertheless, the significant proportion of people marrying outside
their hometowns offers strong evidence that these restricted marriage
markets helped to foster mobility in the spatially dispersed urban
network of the highlands of São Paulo.

The consequence of the pattern of family-related mobility was that,
although the geographic extent of settlement increased rapidly, the
small urban enclaves remained socially connected among themselves and,
through frail links with the littoral, to the rest of the empire. In
this sense, the alliances forged through marriage weaved through the
discontinuous space in the highlands of São Paulo. While living in the
remoteness of their farms, ranches, and small villages, colonists
produced enduring ties with people in similar isolated circumstances. In
this sense, moving to the interior was not an act of leaving their
social world behind. On the contrary, it meant extending the Portuguese
colonization to a new region where, through these family links,
colonists reproduced their mode of living on the fringes of the empire
despite the weak grasp of the Portuguese monarchy. These kinship
networks guaranteed a cohesive and densely linked social space.

The needs for fertile land, enslaved native labor, or spouses made the
inhabitants of São Paulo a distinctively mobile social group. They grew
accustomed to life in the isolation of the backlands, in their farms and
away from the urban cores; learned to travel long distances and survive
in the harsh environment of the backlands; and developed social
practices that, even in a sparsely populated region, granted spatial
cohesion and belonging to the empire. Nevertheless, the geographic
extent of the Portuguese occupation remained limited to the towns
neighboring São Paulo, and its enlargement did not mean significant
demographic growth. Although the expansion of agriculture gradually
claimed more land for the king of Portugal, long-distance expeditions
resulted in a process of depopulation of the backlands. The spread of
diseases, warfare, disruption of communities, and forced relocation to
Portuguese settlements sharply reduced the size of indigenous groups
living in the interior of the continent.[^27]

The Portuguese Occupation of the Backlands
==========================================

The spatial practices that the inhabitants of São Paulo developed during
the 17^th^ century acquired distinctive meanings after the discovery of
extensive mineral deposits in central Brazil. Expeditions departing from
the inland towns of the captaincy spotted several gold strikes in the
interior during the 1690s, and the settling of these areas followed
rapidly. These discoveries were intimately related to the wayfaring of
the people of São Paulo, who redeployed their knowledge and experience
in journeying the vast interior of South America to fulfill the
long-standing hopes of uncovering mineral treasuries. Moreover, the mode
of spatial organization of the settlements that were created in these
remote areas resembled that of the constellation of small towns in the
highlands of São Paulo. Social ties, such as those established through
marital alliances, remained spatially dispersed, facilitating economic
transactions, information exchange, spread of Portuguese institutions,
and cultural assimilation -- despite the gargantuan distances that set
settlements apart. On the one hand, the mobility of relatives to a broad
sector of São Paulo's society increased the access to the resources of
the backlands (now including mineral wealth); on the other, it helped to
consolidate the Portuguese occupation and extension of the empire to
these remote areas.

The leading role of the inhabitants of São Paulo in mineral prospecting
came about with the confluence of the growing knowledge about the
backlands and the recognition by imperial administrators of this
vocation. Simultaneously to their wayfaring in the 17^th^ century, the
monarchy commissioned a handful of explorers to search for precious
minerals that were believed to be hidden in the heartlands of the
continent. Gold strikes were eventually found along some rivers, but the
proceedings were much below the expectations and the overall enterprise
was considered a tremendous debacle.[^28] The sense of disappointment
was so huge that a governor, when commissioned to this task, replied to
his superior that "even though he was put in charge of the examination
and inspection of the gold and silver mines of Paranaguá, Itabaiana, and
Serra de Sabarabuçu, he would not go on this commission, because it was
already collapsing and therefore he had not made any progress."

The frustration with the consecutive failures of crown-appointed
explorers made the crown to call upon to the people of São Paulo. While
cynical about his own chances of finding minerals, the governor provided
an alternative in a report he read in the Overseas Council. It suggested
that the inhabitants of São Paulo "should be the righteous discoverers
of the treasuries that nature and fortune deposited most appropriately
in the lands they first settled." Not only did they have the right, but
also the skills, experience, and ingenuity required to carry on this
enterprise, argued the governor. [^29] Despite their negative
reputation, these imperial subjects had been summoned on a few occasions
to support the empire in enterprises related to the backlands. Troops
from São Paulo had joined the fight against the Dutch and the backlands
of Angola as well as had a pivotal role in the destruction of the
Quilombo dos Palmares, a community of fugitive slaves in the
interiorized areas of the northeast. Over time, terms like *mamelucos*,
*paulistas*, *sertanejos*, and *sertanistas* were often used to describe
the population of São Paulo and became synonyms of wayfaring the
backlands.[^30]

In fact, the idea of calling these subjects to the task of uncovering
mineral wealth materialized even before the governor offered his opinion
in Lisbon. Families from São Paulo were already supporting crown
explorers and prospecting expeditions with stores, Indian slaves, and
information, but, after receiving a series of royal letters in the
1670s, they took a more active attitude in mineral prospecting. In these
letters, the king assured, as existing legislation already mandated, an
extensive series of privileges such as nobility titles, gifts, pensions,
and royal favor to the discoverers of the mines in Brazil, prompting
several of these *sertanejos* to repurpose their journeys in the
backlands to conduct mineral prospecting. The most notorious attempt was
led by veteran slaver Fernão Dias Paes. He spent many years in the
Cataguazes region in the late 1670s, supposedly finding emeralds (which
turned out to be semi-precious tourmalines), but his death in the
backlands at the age of 73 abbreviated these efforts. Other expeditions
followed, including one led by crown explorer D. Rodrigo de
Castel-Blanco in 1681, which counted with the participation of local
residents. Yet conclusive evidence of mineral deposits was only reported
in the late 1690s.[^31]

Although mineral prospecting intensified in the late 17^th^ century and
slavers gradually turned into mineral prospectors and miners, the mode
of journeying the backlands remained the same. The socioeconomic
organization of the prospecting expeditions still relied on relatives to
raise resources and recruit qualified explorers, and the techniques of
moving and surviving in the backlands resembled those of the older
generation of *sertanejos*. Most important, the repertoire of
geographical knowledge and travel itineraries developed over a century
of wanderings and nurtured within family informed the steps taken by
these explorers. Kinsfolk revisited regions where relatives traveled
together to enslave Indians with a different purpose. In this sense, the
inhabitants of São Paulo redeployed the spatial practices when they saw
the opportunity, under incentives and assurances of the crown, to reap
the benefits of mining in Brazil.

Unsurprisingly, the region where the first gold strikes were spotted has
been the object of interest of the inhabitants of São Paulo since the
mid-17^th^ century. The Cataguazes region, which gained its name from an
Indian group that inhabited the area, was associated with the
long-standing indigenous myth of the Sabarabuçu mountain, reputed as the
Brazilian Eldorado.[^32] Besides this marvelous geography, the dynamics
imposed by slash-and-burn agriculture and the craving for Indians slaves
stirred the people of São Paulo in that direction. As they extended the
farmable area over the Atlantic rainforest to compensate for the
exhausted farmland, they reached the valley of the Paraíba River (on the
edges of the Cataguazes) around the 1640s, leading to the foundation of
the town of Taubaté. In the following decades, the area between the
Serra do Mar and the Serra da Mantiqueira, a stretch of land
approximately 100 miles long and 10 miles wide, saw the creation of two
other towns -- Guaratinguetá (1651) and Pindamonhangaba (1705) -- with
the older urban core of Taubaté becoming almost as large as the town of
São Paulo by the end of the century.[^33] Around the same period,
slaving expeditions started to focus on that valley and adjacent
regions. In fact, with the relocation of the Jesuit mission further
south in Spanish territory, the Cataguazes became the preferred region
for slave raids, and at least 30 different expeditions were outfitted to
journey the area (around half of all expeditions listed by Monteiro for
the second half of the 17^th^ century.)[^34]

The geographical knowledge produced through journeying the backlands and
shared among kinsfolk was crucial for the success of prospecting
enterprises. For example, the itinerary that led to one of the first
discoveries, spearheaded by Bartolomeu Bueno da Siqueira in 1697, was
given by his brother-in-law Antônio Rodrigues Arzão.[^35] Moreover,
although he developed the route to mineral deposits in the Cataguazes in
the years preceding his death in 1696, Arzão was probably very familiar
with the region for a long time as his father and an uncle led
expeditions there in 1662 and 1679.[^36] In a similar vein, the
unsuccessful expedition of Fernão Dias Paes was resumed by his son
Garcia. He was already in charge of the returning party after the death
of his father in the backlands, but, after arriving in São Paulo, Garcia
outfitted a new expedition to return to the same area. There, his uncle
awaited with equipment and subsistence plots. In the early 18^th^
century, Garcia traveled to the region again, now under the auspices of
the governor-general of Brazil, to open a road between the mining region
and Rio de Janeiro.[^37]

Family knowledge was also crucial for mineral discoveries in other
regions of central Brazil. In 1720, a partnership of three veteran
*sertanejos* -- a father-in-law with a son-in-law and his brother --
organized an expedition to Goiás, which was justified on the grounds
that the expedition leader "was familiar for have already wandered the
backlands of the Americas in expeditions they have done." [^38] When he
was a 12-year-old boy, Bartolomeu joined his namesake father in a
slaving raid against the Goiá people, acquiring extensive knowledge
about the human geography of the region, as attested by the
comprehensive listing of ethnic groups in the petition to the captaincy
governor. With official approval, they outfitted an expedition that
spent three years exploring the region until they found plentiful gold
strikes.

Similarly, kinship networks also paved the way for the occupation of
these areas. For instance, the members of the expedition led by
Siqueira, as recollected by an early settler, "after finding gold in
significant amounts, sowed new plots and sent out for their relatives
and friends in São Paulo and nearby towns to come there and establish
themselves."[^39] The expedition to Goiás probably functioned in the
same way, as the genealogical records show that several relatives of the
expedition leaders ended up settling in the region. From the
son-in-law's side, whose extended family lived in the coastal town of
São Sebastião, at least six people (among their and their siblings'
children) migrated to Goiás during their lives. In the next generation
of the family, three grandchildren (whose parents did not migrate) also
moved there.

The transformation of slavers into miners also favored more permanent
forms of settlement and territorialization. Besides the creation of new
towns in the manner and style of Portuguese legislation, requests for
land grants (*sesmarias*) had a pivotal role in laying out an
institutional ground for the extension of the Portuguese empire in the
interior. Again, the wayfaring of relatives informed where colonists
claimed these new tracts of land. In the 1720s and 1730s, for instance,
Luis Pedroso de Barros and his brother requested a few plots in the
headwaters of the Paranapanema River, a couple hundred miles southward
of São Paulo, precisely in the region where his father-in-law discovered
gold in the late 17^th^ century. The petitions used several toponyms,
including the indigenous names of rivers of the Paranapanema watershed,
revealing their extensive knowledge about the physical geography of the
region.[^40]

Land claiming also took the form of a family enterprise, as suggested by
the strategies adopted by Luis' kin. In 1704, a coalition of 26
supplicants led by his uncle, Pedro Taques de Almeida (and including
children, siblings, and in-laws), requested an enormous land grant of
900,000 hectares (2.2 million acres) in the region next to his nephew's
properties. (The extended family filed another petition, almost
identical in its form, dimensions, and claimants, but requesting land in
the Minas Gerais region.) The artifice of enlisting the entire family to
justify the enormous proportions of the grants did not persuade the
governor, who only approved the standard 2,000 hectares (5,000 acres)
plots for the family.[^41] The temporary setback did not inhibit the
family's ambitions. In the following years, family members requested,
individually or in small groups, several other plots in the lands
adjacent to the first concession. By the 1720s, the family held more
than 30 land grants in the region, almost recreating the extent of the
original request.[^42] Besides incorporating these lands through
judicial instruments recognized by the empire, these requests registered
for the first time the names of faraway, unheard-of places in the
records of the bureaucracy of the empire.

In this section, I’m attempting to further my argument even though the main evidentiary base – the genealogical dataset – is limited. While the dataset gives the overall picture of the spatial practices of the inhabitants of São Paulo, it is less forthright about the texture and scale of their mobile lifestyles. These aspects of social life aren’t easily translated as data. By reconstituting the life story of Pedro Taques de Almeida Paes Leme using other sources, I tried to give the dimensions to which his life and his contemporaries’ were lived simultaneously in many places.

The option of sidelining methodological discussion made this transition easier however. Since my narrative isn’t an exploration of a method and its potentialities, I could, without any embarrassment, simply move to a different approach to qualify part of the argument I was making. I didn’t feel the need to have a long discussion about the limitations of my method, for instance.

The land ownership did not diminish the mobility of the people of São
Paulo. In fact, the survival of settlements created in the backlands
depended on the continual exchanges that the flow of people afforded,
and several of the families of first settlers kept property, businesses,
agents, and political and social relations spread between distant
locations. The land grants requested by the Taques de Almeida family,
for instance, were used to create ranches, which were managed through an
agent.[^43] On these properties, the clan raised cattle, mules, and
horses that were sold in the interior of São Paulo and in mining areas,
where the family kept a flourishing commercial enterprise.[^44]
Eventually, two young members of the family moved to the region and
married into the local elite, thus reinforcing the ties that the clan
forged with this distant district throughout the years.

In the years following the discovery of minerals, several inhabitants of
São Paulo relocated to the expanding zones of the Portuguese occupation.
The dislocation between birth and marriage in genealogical records, as
summarized in Figure 4, indicates that these individuals remained
seeking marital alliances outside their hometowns. In the south, the
mobility of spouses paralleled the emergence of an economic circuit
related to the emerging livestock economy, such as suggested by the
trajectory of the Taques de Almeida family. Marital alliances in the
towns associated with ranching, such as Itu, Sorocaba, and Curitiba,
strengthened while a significant contingent of São Paulo-born people
continued to move to these frontier towns. Furthermore, these
settlements also began to send spouses to the extreme south of
Portuguese America, in the territory of Rio de Grande de São Pedro, a
major livestock supplier for the rest of the colony.[^45]

Digital historians and humanists claim that visualizations make arguments. If I were to choose a visualization that best encapsulates my argument, it would be this one. It gives the scale of the movement undertaken by the inhabitants of São Paulo and demonstrates, through the thickness of the lines, how kinship connected different locations. The overall impression I tried to make is a space that is connected and made cohesive through family ties.

Inter-regional connections were stronger with the captaincy of Minas
Gerais, represented by the towns of São João del Rei, São José del Rei,
Vila Rica, and Mariana. Neither military conflicts between São
Paulo-born settlers and "outsiders" in the first years of settlement nor
the political autonomy of the region, which became an independent
captaincy in 1720, lessened the ties between the regions.[^46] Southern
Minas Gerais and the northern part of the captaincy of São Paulo,
notably Taubaté, were particularly connected. Of the 51 spouses born in
this town, 19 entered wedlock in the mining region while only 14 chose
to establish themselves in a different location within the limits of São
Paulo. People from São Paulo, Jundiaí, and Mogi-Mirim and adjacent towns
also married in the mining region, but in smaller proportions.

Portuguese-born men were the group that appeared the most among the
spouses recorded in the genealogical data for the first half of the
18^th^ century. They were listed marrying in the same regions in which
the inhabitants of São Paulo were established, including older and newer
urban cores of the captaincy as well as in the expanding mining zones.
At least 50 grooms and a few brides found their spouses in a location in
Minas Gerais, but the majority preferred to enter wedlock in the older
captaincy. The city of São Paulo, for instance, received 44 spouses from
Portugal and the Atlantic islands (mostly from the Azores); other towns
in the captaincy, on average, welcomed a dozen of them each. Their
inclusion in the genealogical data, which register their strategy of
joining local families, shows a distinct picture of wandering men
looking for fortune in faraway mining regions, as often depicted in the
historiography. Instead, the fact that nearly three quarters of the
Portuguese spouses married in the inland towns of São Paulo suggests
that they first established themselves, through marital alliances, in
consolidated places where they forged local relationships that
eventually enabled them to depart to the interior.

Goiás and Mato Grosso, two other mining regions with strong ties to the
families of São Paulo, were curiously absent from the registers of the
mobility of spouses in the first half of the 18^th^ century. The late
discovery and occupation of these regions, after the third decade of
that century, account for this anomaly. Moreover, the lack of records of
people being born in the captaincy of São Paulo and marrying in these
new areas points to a distinct spatial dynamic. First, most of the
records of those who married in Goiás and Mato Grosso did not indicate
the place of birth. In fact, natives from the most established families
of São Paulo tended to have their places of birth under-recorded, as
their attachment to their hometown was implicit in the family narrative
-- information about birth was more prevalent to outsiders joining these
family lineages. Second, as suggested in the vignette of the first
expedition that uncovered gold in Goiás, it is likely that many of the
marital alliances were established in São Paulo and facilitated their
movement in the interior. As in the slaving raids of the previous
century, marrying locally would allow them to marshal resources to
explore the new regions, but this movement would go unrecorded in the
genealogies.

This trend changed in the second half of the 18^th^ century.
Genealogical records for this period (Figure 5) mentioned Goiás and Mato
Grosso more often but indicated a different pattern in the movement:
they were mostly traveling eastward, returning from the mining areas to
the towns of São Paulo. The dataset shows at least 30 individuals that
were in Goiás and Mato Grosso and returned to the captaincy to enter
wedlock. Furthermore, they displayed a clear preference for the
westernmost towns of the captaincy, with Itu and Sorocaba as the most
prominent destinations. The choice of returning to the captaincy of São
Paulo was not unusual. These spouses were looking for partners in
regions that had been associated with their families even before they
were born and where they had cultivated, despite being away for many
years, strong social, political, and economic connections.

{{< figure src="/img/image8.png" title="Figure 5" alt="Map showing movement of spouses" caption="Spatial trajectories of spouses in the second half of the 18^th^ century (1750-1800), based on places of birth and marriage listed in the genealogical records. Although the mobility of spouses kept the same geographic extent, the proportion of long-distance trajectories decreased during the period, favoring short-distance mobility. Connections between urban centers in São Paulo with Mato Grosso and Goiás reveal a large number of \"returnees\" -- people that were born in the mining areas but returned to their parents' hometowns to find spouses." >}}

The sparseness of the dataset does not allow an appraisal of the scale
of the flux of returnees. However, cases of two-way, multi-generational
mobility, such as represented by João and Maria's vignette at the
beginning of this article, offer compelling evidence of the reiteration
over time of journeys between the newer settlements in the backlands and
São Paulo. Another paradigmatic case is a family headed by Isabel de
Campos, who married a young man from Guaratinguetá in her hometown, Itu,
in 1746. Eventually, the couple moved to Goiás and had seven children
there. In 1771, when the sixth child was born in that mining district,
Isabel's oldest child was in Itu marrying a local man. In the following
years, the remaining children also relocated to Itu and married there,
and none of them seem to have moved again: all six of Isabel's
grandchildren listed in the *Genealogia* ended up marrying locally in
Itu by the turn of the 18^th^ century.

João and Maria's or Isabel's family mobility represents a larger pattern
and illustrates the decision of moving of many colonists. These spatial
practices suggest the maintenance over time of the connections between
distant places and resemble, in a much larger geographic extent, the
dispersed but cohesive space of the highlands of São Paulo in the 17^th^
century. In a sense, these people developed a way of living between two
or more places and became accustomed to distance and absences. Marital
alliances created enduring relationships that, on the one hand, enabled
mobility to new frontier zones and unclaimed resources and, on the
other, guaranteed a home and community to those who returned. Indeed,
the homeland was always there, and several individuals that were lured
to the mining frontiers in the early years retired in the property they
held or inherited in São Paulo -- though these stories are less visible
in the genealogical records. The fact that their return (and that of
their children) seemed to happen effortlessly indicates that the ties to
their hometowns never faded away.

The patterns gathered from this analysis also hint at spatial practices
that are not evident in the genealogical records. While the mismatch
between the place of birth and marriage provides an overall sense of
circulation of people across space, the existence of the social ties
after many years suggests that the volume of traffic between these
locations was higher than recorded in the data. Once again, snippets of
a life story, entangled in the dense web of family relationships,
highlight the main characteristics of the itinerant lives of the
families from São Paulo.

A Mobile Life in the Backlands
==============================

In 1714, Pedro Taques de Almeida Paes Leme was born in the city of São
Paulo to two of the most distinguished families of the captaincy.
Pedro's mother was one of the 26 petitioners who, under the leadership
of his grandfather, requested the enormous land grants in Curitiba and
Minas Gerais. His family had been associated with mining since the early
17^th^ century when his great-great-grandfather (also named Pedro
Taques) accompanied the first crown-appointed explorer to inspect the
mines of São Paulo and remained in the region. Since then, the lineage
of the Taques had occupied several leadership positions in the captaincy
and engaged actively in slave-raiding and exploiting of the backlands.
They were part of the expeditions that discovered mineral wealth in
central Brazil, and several of Pedro's close relatives were among the
first settlers of Minas Gerais. The father's side, the Lemes family, was
even more prominent. They settled in São Vicente in the mid-16^th^
century and sprawled in several small branches that spread among the
towns in the highlands of São Paulo. The family also included several
*sertanejos*, like Pedro's uncle Fernão Dias Paes, the leader of the
famed expedition to search for emeralds. The wayfaring of the backlands
was part of his family legacy.

During his lifetime, mostly spent in São Paulo, Pedro developed a strong
relationship with Goiás. His father was one of the three partners of the
excursion that discovered gold in that region, being responsible for
raising funds and supporting the expedition while it was in the
backlands. As part of the agreement with the other leaders (his brother
and his brother's father-in-law) and colonial authorities, Pedro's
father gained the right to explore the passage (that is, charge toll) of
three of the rivers on the route to Goiás for three generations. When
his father died in 1738, Pedro and his siblings inherited these rights
as well as ranches in Curitiba (created in the land grants he requested
with his father-in-law) and several business assets in the Mato Grosso
region, which were managed by a commission agent.[^47]

Little is known about Pedro's younger years, besides his education in
the local Jesuit college and his appointment as sergeant-major of the
local militia in 1737, two years after his first marriage to the
daughter of the cavalry captain of Goiás. Although familiar with the
region since he was young, Pedro's first recorded trip to Goiás only
happened at the age of 35, when he relocated to the mines of Pilar, a
thriving mining center, in the mid-18^th^ century. He spent five years
in the region supervising his mining business and serving as a fiscal
officer. After accumulating a small fortune, he briefly returned to São
Paulo but soon departed for Lisbon, where he intended to petition the
higher courts of the kingdom for confirmation of the rights of passage
he inherited, which were under judicial litigation. The travel was
untimely, as he reached the empire's capital a few days before the
catastrophic 1755 earthquake that destroyed Lisbon, including personal
property and documents he brought to support his case. Although
unsuccessful in his primary goal, Pedro returned to Brazil in 1757
holding the office of Treasurer of the Bull of the Holy Crusade (to
collect indulgences sold to support warfare and rescue of Catholic
captives in North Africa) of the captaincies of São Paulo, Goiás, and
Mato Grosso. His experience with mining also gained him another office
in the following years, Keeper (*guarda-mor*) of the Mines of São Paulo,
in 1763, which required him to travel to several parts of the captaincy.

In the same way Pedro's fortune was associated with the distant Goiás,
it was also the source of his demise. A decade after taking office as
Treasurer, one of the agents he appointed to oversee the selling of the
bulls in Goiás failed to remit the proceedings, making Pedro default the
royal coffers. As a consequence, he had most of his property confiscated
and sold in public auction. His reputation was also ruined. In 1771,
Pedro was recorded as a resident of the city of São Paulo, living off of
the products of his small rural estates, but, as his biographer noted,
he kept another agent in Goiás managing the extraction of gold in the
mining fields he still owned in the region.[^48] A few years before his
death in 1777, Pedro traveled again to Lisbon to appeal for his paternal
rights over the route to Goiás, successfully this time. The good news
came late, though, as Pedro died soon after returning to his hometown.

The vital events of Pedro Taques de Almeida Paes Leme's life -- his
birth, death, and three marriages -- all happened in the same location,
the city of São Paulo. Therefore, the connections to the places that
shaped the course of his life were overlooked in the analysis of the
trajectory of spouses. Furthermore, as with most of the people who
settled in the backlands during the 18^th^ century, it is impossible to
tell how many times Pedro took the route to Goiás or any other region in
which he and his family held businesses. Still, his life undoubtedly
depended on events happening simultaneously in several parts of the
empire. From the decision about mining policies, grants, and offices
taken in Lisbon to the organization of expeditions by his ancestors, the
spread and mobility of relatives, and the creation of partnerships
through family and agents, the life of Pedro was carried out in this
fragmented geography and only possible through his capacity to move and
forge lasting connections across space.

For the crown, these spatial practices and the dispersed-but-woven
geography it produced enabled the extension of its empire in the
backlands at an unprecedented scale. Although not directly acting in the
name of the empire, the wayfaring and settling of the families of São
Paulo unlocked a massive pool of resources that precipitated the
creation of the imperial bureaucracy in these new areas. These settlers
composed the bodies of governance, commanded local militia, and
organized the fiscal and judicial apparatuses of the state -- they were
the *de facto* representatives of the empire in these distant regions.
Furthermore, their mobility also facilitated the economic integration of
the backlands. Settling required the reallocation of the family assets,
the formation of new commercial circuits, and the constant flow of
information between places. Overall, the mobility of people like Pedro
rendered an abstract notion of "conquest" that was claimed by the king
of Portugal into a real part of the empire.

Retelling Family Stories
========================

In the second half of the 18^th^ century, the spatial practices of the
inhabitants of São Paulo became constrained to a reduced geographic
extent as inter-regional connections weakened. Over time, these family
networks tended to become more regionalized as the dynamism of the
mining economy began to wear off. The genealogical records demonstrate
that the percentage of spouses marrying outside their captaincy of
origin, including both São Paulo and Minas Gerais, decreased
significantly. The only town that continued sending spouses to distant
places at the same rate as earlier in the century was São José del Rei,
a mining town in southern Minas Gerais, whose natives married in twelve
different locations of three captaincies (mostly in São Paulo). Most
likely, they represent a large group of returnees from a region that had
strong connections with traditional family branches of São Paulo.
Nevertheless, the proportion of spouses marrying outside their captaincy
of origin nearly halved in the other towns.

  | **Place of Birth** | **1700-1750**  | **1750-1800** |
  | ------------------ | -------------- | ------------- |
  | *Captaincy of São Paulo* |  |  |                 
  | Itu                          | 4.4% (45)   |    3.4% (87) ↓ |
  | Jundiaí                      | 18.2% (11)  |    7.5% (93) ↓ |
  | Mogi das Cruzes              | 25.0% (20)  |    12.7% (63) ↓ |
  | São Paulo                    | 10.9% (128) |    4.4% (248) ↓ |
  | Taubaté                      | 31.4% (51)  |    18.9% (95) ↓ |
  | *Captaincy of Minas Gerais*  |  |  |                 
  | São José del Rei             | 14.3% (14)  |    14.6% (41) ↑ |
  | São João del Rei             | 29.4% (17)  |    18.6% (355) ↓ |

*Table 1*. Percentage of spouses that married outside their captaincy of
origin. Data suggests, in most cases, a decrease in long-distance
relationships. Numbers in parentheses indicate the total number of
observations (i.e., the total number of marriages for the period). Only
towns with more than 10 observations in the first period were listed.

At the same time, certain regional connections became stronger. For
example, Itu and Sorocaba, which were about a day of travel from each
other, increased the number of spouses exchanged. Families from Itu
increased the proportion of bachelors they sent to Sorocaba to enter
wedlock, from a fifth to a quarter of the total number of recorded
marriages. The same happened in the opposite direction: 42% (of 115) of
the documented marriages of people born in Sorocaba happened in Itu, in
contrast to the previous 35% (of 37.) Through these connections, this
livestock-producing region became increasingly socially cohesive.

This process of regionalization is also visible in the increasing
proportion of people that died in the same places they entered wedlock.
With the notable exception of the city of São Paulo, the tendency of
permanently settling after marriage became more pronounced as the 18^th^
century passed (Table 2). Marriage and the formation of a new household
reduced or ceased the mobility of individuals. Furthermore, the
outwardness of São Paulo -- the only place that decreased in
post-marriage permanent settling -- is deceptive. Besides four
individuals that died in Goiás and Mato Grosso after marrying in that
city, the remaining 119 recorded colonists died either in São Paulo or
one of the inland towns of the captaincy. The shift of the direction of
the movement, from the mining regions to nearby towns, marked the
increasing centrality that the city had in the spatial organization of
the captaincy. São Paulo had already been the central node of the urban
network in the captaincy since the early 17^th^ century, but colonists
gravitated towards frontier towns as they concentrated the most coveted
resources. By the end of the century, the situation changed. The
political restoration of the captaincy in 1765 favored the strengthening
of São Paulo's supremacy, and the exchanges within the captaincy seemed
to become more dependent on the connections to the capital city.

  | **Towns**  |       **1700-1750**  | **1750-1800** |
  |------------|----------------------|-------------|
  |Itu       |        73.4% (128)  |   87.8% (123) ↑|
  |Jundiaí    |       75.9% (29)   |   98.9% (95) ↑|
  |Mogi das Cruzes  | 81.1% (53)   |   87.8% (47) ↑|
  |São Paulo     |    71.3% (147)  |   45.5% (124) ↓|
  |Taubaté        |   79.3% (29)   |   87.9% (33) ↑|

*Table 2*. Percentage of recorded deaths in which the deceased died in
the same place as he or she was born. The growing proportion of this
type of case suggests the decline in geographic mobility towards the end
of the 18^th^ century.

The restoration of the captaincy also changed the imperial attitude
towards the mobility of the inhabitants of São Paulo. In 1750, the new
secretary of state, Marquis de Pombal, rose to power, leading a series
of administrative reforms in Portugal and its overseas empire.[^49]
After arriving in 1765, new governor D. Luís Antonio de Sousa
implemented measures to improve the economy, reform the military, and
reorganize the territory of the captaincy. He founded towns, carried out
nominal censuses, enacted anti-vagrancy laws, and implemented
state-sponsored migration to the frontier regions and other policies
that conflicted with a quite mobile population. The governor envisioned
a captaincy formed by a collection of well-ordered, disciplined
settlements under his firm control -- and he perceived the wayfaring and
dispersion of the people of São Paulo as a considerable obstacle to
it.[^50]

Yet, despite being questioned by colonial authorities, the mobility of
the inhabitants of São Paulo was repurposed in the imperial narratives
and became instrumental for geopolitical goals. In 1750, when Spanish
and Portuguese ambassadors came to the negotiation table to discuss the
boundaries between their domains in the Americas, the footprints left by
their spatial practices were vital to sustain Portuguese ambitions of an
enlarged territory. By suggestion of Alexandre de Gusmão, a São
Paulo-born diplomat who led the negotiations for the Portuguese camp,
the plenipotentiaries meeting in Madrid adopted the legal principle of
*uti possidetis*, which granted possession to those who occupied the
land in practice, to solve the territorial quarrel.[^51] The settlements
the people of São Paulo created and sustained in the interior, even
though small and sparse, and the extensive geographic knowledge they
produced allowed the Portuguese to consolidate the frontier westward.
Indeed, the map used during the negotiations -- the well-known *Mapa das
Cortes* -- included information provided by these early explorers.[^52]

During the "golden age" of colonial Brazil, family relationships shaped
the movement of colonists in the interior of South America. By sharing
information about the backlands, providing resources to expeditions, and
creating an intangible structure to foster these spatial practices,
families from São Paulo developed a model of empire-building hitherto
untested by the Portuguese. In a sense, the insular mode of spatial
organization typical of overseas domains, where coastal settlements were
connected through maritime routes, was partially replicated inland. Not
unlike the fortresses, trading posts, and port cities that composed the
overseas empire, the towns, villages, parishes, ranches, and mining
camps in the backlands were small pockets of European occupation where
colonists congregated to carry out their lives according to Portuguese
customs and laws while conducting their businesses and family affairs.

Nevertheless, the way these locations in the backlands remained
connected to the rest of the empire differed from their counterparts in
the littoral. Instead of a regular transit of ships, people organized
expeditions among relatives to travel to isolated regions of the
continent. When settled, they preserved the social ties that connected
them to their hometowns, which facilitated a piecemeal, everyday type of
mobility that made distant mining towns, ranches, and farms an integral
part of the empire. Family ties connected not only people, but a
territory otherwise highly fragmented. In a broad sense, the mobility of
kin created inter-regional networks that sustained territories claimed
by states, even in geographical settings which these political units and
their bureaucracy were poorly equipped to face.

    encompassed a variegated set of groups that did not share cultural
    traits other than the fact that they did not speak the *lingua

[^46]: As an outcome of the military conflicts in the first decade of
    the 18^th^ century, the monarchy elevated the status of São Paulo
    from town to city to appease the complaints of the inhabitants of
    São Paulo who felt that their privileges in the mining region were
    being disregarded in favor of outsiders. In 1709, the captaincy of
    São Vicente was thus renamed, and the seat of the governor was
    permanently transferred to the city. A new reorganization of the
    colony in 1720, to embitter the people of São Paulo again, made
    Minas Gerais independent from São Paulo, and in the following years,
    other regions were dismembered until the captaincy of São Paulo lost
    its autonomy in 1748. It remained under the jurisdiction of Rio de
    Janeiro until 1765, when a new governor was finally appointed to
    restore the captaincy. Cf. Beatriz Piccolotto Siqueira Bueno,

    Capitania de São Paulo (1532-1822)," *Anais do Museu Paulista (Nova
