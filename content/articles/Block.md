This piece originated from David Newman’s work in then-brand-new technology of probabilistic topic modeling. Sharon Block quickly saw the potential value in this massive data mining tool for historical analysis and the two successfully received funding from University of California, Irvine to undertake several case studies. Sharon’s interest in sexism in the historical profession led to this analysis of the place of women’s history in historical publishing. Because full text journals were not available, we turned to (what were then) widely-used database abstracts that covered historical publishing from c. 1450-present.

One of the challenges of the piece was satisfying reviewers. While this is true of all peer-reviewed scholarship, in addition to many helpful critiques, some reviewers were not sure how to evaluate this interdisciplinary work. Some seemed to view it as outsiders writing about women’s history (double blind review meant that readers did not know that one author very definitely considers herself a women’s historian), some misunderstood how topic modeling works, and as a whole, reviewers disagreed on the ideal purpose of the essay. The title aimed to signal that while we address issues relevant to current historical debates, our primary focus was to explore, not necessarily explain, the patterns we newly identified. Our idea was that this piece would provide hard data as an impetus for others to do further investigation into sexism in historical publishing.

{{% notation title="Starting With Women’s History Historiography" %}}
Setting this piece within the context of debates in women’s history was important to me – especially because one of the early readers believed that the authors were computational interlopers who did not know or care about the field.
{{% /notation %}}

In the past half decade, prominent historians have quantified
scholarship on women's history to analyze the state of the field. In a
2004 publication, Gerda Lerner tallied 720 recent U.S. women's history
articles, books and dissertations from the *Journal of American
History's* list of Current Scholarship by time period and theme. In her
2006 book, Judith Bennett quantified scholarship in various women's
history journals and conferences to show an overemphasis on more recent
time periods. In 2007, Merry Wiesner-Hanks analyzed the regional focus
of Berkshire Women's History Conference papers and *Journal of Women's
History* publications in her essay on the place of women, gender and
sexuality in World History.[^1] Other scholars have published state of
the field pieces that provide qualitative analyses of women's and gender
history.[^2]

{{% notation title="Timeline" %}}
It took three years from submission to publication
(partly due to editorial turnover) which meant that the scholarship
under review was already more outdated than I would have wanted at
publication -- ending in 2005 for a 2011 article. It was not possible
to retroactively include abstracts later than 2005 because redoing the
topic models would have meant starting from scratch.
{{% /notation %}}

{{% notation title="Figures for Historians" %}}

This article is clearly structured around data analysis, as represented in tables, charts, and graphs. But in an indication of one of the difficulties of stretching beyond traditional disciplinary methodological boundaries, the original copy editors did not realize there were 16 images that went with the article. This was far beyond the journal's standard maximum number of figures of 3-4 per article which meant I had to get editorial permission to publish an article with that many figures. The permission was not difficult to get, but did strike me as an indication of how far outside the mainstream this kind of data representation was for this women’s history journal.

{{% /notation %}}

Quantitative and qualitative analyses provide these women's historians
with a sense of the developments in much of our field and point to
remaining shortcomings and opportunities. This article builds on the
desire to understand the scope and achievements of women's history by
providing a more comprehensive quantitative overview of the place of a
large segment of women's history within a large segment of historical
publishing between 1985 and 2005. Our analysis examines more than a half
million abstracts from two widely used article databases that cover
historical study since c.1450. We use these to explore the place of
women and women's history within the historical field in general, and
within regional and chronologic subfields in particular. While women's
history reflects some overall shifts in the historical profession, it
also has a demonstrably separable trajectory in terms of its expansion,
content, and regional/chronological foci.

{{% notation title="Feminist Topic Modeling" %}}
While topic modeling has not seen
widespread use in women's history, in 2014, the feminist journal *Signs*
used topic modeling to build an interactive tool to interrogate its past
forty years of publications ("Signs @ 40 1975-2014,"
[http://signsat40.signsjournal.org/topic-model/](http://signsat40.signsjournal.org/topic-model/)
{{% /notation %}}

We then move to exploring the approximately 31,000 abstracts that we
identified as women's history-focused. We look at shifts in article
publication patterns between 1985 and 2005 to see how the field has --
and has not\-- changed. We directly explore the content and range of
post-c.1450 women's history across these two decades, and question
whether a seemingly more twentieth-century focus of women's history is a
by-product of overall developments, a more complicated transformation,
or less of a shift than it might originally appear. We also track the
regional and chronological subject area variations within women's
history abstracts, and suggest that this be a starting point for
discussions of the place of women's history within various subfields. In
the paper's final section, we select a single topic area -- sexuality
\-- for deeper analysis. We identify broad subject areas covered within
sexuality histories and trace their variations across time and place of
study, suggesting the value of this kind of quantitative exploration.

{{% notation title="Proof of Concept meets Feminism" %}}
I originally envisioned this as a
proof of concept or case study exercise that showed the value of topic
modeling to the field of women's history; an area of inquiry that is
known for innovative but often not quantitative methodological
innovations. Even in 2008, it seemed clear to me that feminist scholars
were not recognized players in data mining and massive corpus analyses.
For these reasons, it was important to me to do research that married
data mining to feminist analysis.
{{% /notation %}}

Thus, as our title suggests, we are addressing several "whats, wheres,
and whens" of two decades of post-c.1450 women's history: *what* place
does women's history have in the field at large and *what* kind of
subjects are included within women's history; *where* in various
regional histories does women's history most frequently appear; *when*
do publications on women's history increase or decrease in numbers as
well as *when*, chronologically, women's historians most focus their
efforts.

{{% notation title="Essay Goals" %}}
This paragraph was meant to answer conflicting reader
recommendations to frame this essay as a state of the field report
versus an analysis of the causes of sexism in historical publication. I
decided to be upfront with both the aims of this piece, and with what it
did not accomplish as a way to manage readers' expectations.
{{% /notation %}}

The "sometimes why" is a more complicated venture. At various points we
forward possible explanations, grounded in historiographic scholarship,
for the trends we have identified. But for the most part, our broad
analysis of tens of thousands of abstracts at a time, aims to recognize
basic patterns that raise as many questions about the constitution of
the field of women's history as they answer. We mean this article to
start a conversation about women's history as revealed through a
large-scale quantitative analysis that provides hard facts, rather than
qualitative impressions, about the field. We conclude by proposing
questions about how we can benefit from this type of interdisciplinary
collaboration, what it might suggest about how we understand the place
of women's history in the field, and the role of the profession and
academic institutions in the support of various kinds of historical
study.

**Methodology**

{{% notation title="The Methodological Challenge" %}}
The methodology section shrank in
revised versions of the essay because discussions of technological
processes seemed to lead to confusion and, most early readers were
not particularly interested in how the technological sausage was made.
It was a challenge, especially when topic modeling was so new, to
describe it in terms historians would understand, so we went with a
citation to my 2006 historian-friendly introduction to topic modeling
\[Sharon Block, "[Doing More with Digitization: An Introduction to
Topic Modeling of Early American
Sources](http://commonplace.online/article/doing-more-with-digitization/),"
*Common-place: the Interactive Journal of Early American Life* 6:2
(January 2006)\]. We did not cite our jointly authored technical piece
\[David Newman and Sharon Block, "[Probabilistic Topic Decomposition
of an Eighteenth-Century American
Newspaper](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1c9xwiSApankjwoLwjE7luo81D_sHQvN5),"
*Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology*
57:6 (April 2006), 753-767\] because it was not aimed at humanities
scholars. Personally, I find methods discussions engaging, and would have
liked to explain more about topic modeling, including topics as most
frequent word lists so that readers could analyze the labels I put on
them for themselves. A web supplement with all that additional
information would be useful if I wrote the article today.
{{% /notation %}}

The main source for this article is 513,259 substantive abstracts of
articles and essays published between 1985-2005 in *America: History and
Life* and *Historical Abstracts* databases. *America: History and Life*
(AHL) focuses on the history of the geographic regions that now make up
the United States and Canada. *Historical Abstracts* (HA) covers the
history of the world outside of North America from approximately 1450
onward. Some of the most widely used abstract databases in the
historical profession, AHL and HA include English and non-English
language publications, and gather historically-oriented articles from
more than 3,000 scholarly journals, including women's studies
publications. These databases are not perfect representations of the
historical profession by any means \-- the exclusion of pre-1450
scholarship may be one of the biggest handicaps \-- but they still
provide a much larger corpus of information than heretofore examined.

{{% notation title="Multiple Methodologies" %}}
Word frequency counts, though hardly an
innovative method, proved to be useful in doing a feminist analysis of
the half million historical abstracts. On various issues, we determined
that a frequency count might support an analytic point more clearly than
topic modeling. This was an excellent reminder that the newest,
snazziest technological innovations don't necessarily yield the best
results in every situation. 

Footnote 5 was added to try to further
explain probabilistic topic modeling after one reader wrongly suggested
that our "database" needed significance tests.
{{% /notation %}}

We analyze this collection of abstracts using two main methodologies.
First, word frequency counting (how often a given word occurs) reveals
how and when terms related to women appear in historical abstracts.[^3]
Second, topic modeling, a computer science data mining technology that
is arguably the state-of-the-art model for text document collections,
allows for a more complex subject analysis.[^4] Topic modeling learns
subject categories without *a priori* subject definitions. Unlike
traditional classification systems where texts are fit into preexisting
schema (such as Library of Congress subject headings), topic modeling
establishes a comprehensive list of subjects through its analysis of the
word co-occurrences throughout the corpus. The content of the
documents---*not* a human indexer---determines the topics collectively
found in those documents, arguably making topic modeling's subject
indices far more sophisticated than human classification.[^5]

{{% notation title="Historiographic Debates" %}}
At the time I wrote this, debates raged
(as much as they could "rage" in a pre-social-media era) on the
distinction between gender and women's history. Hence this explanatory
paragraph.
{{% /notation %}}

Throughout our analysis, we employ a broad definition of women's
history. We include work that focuses on individual women, on women as a
group or groups, and on the power dynamics of patriarchy that some have
shorthanded with the term "gender." We do not single out feminist
scholarship from that which addresses women's experiences without an
interest in patriarchal power structures. In short: we use "women's
history" expansively, to encompass all kinds of scholarship that
addresses women's lives, experiences, and the societal beliefs that
surround them.

{{% notation title="Technical Details" %}}
We did not want to include too many technical
details about the topic modeling in the text, for fear it would alienate
readers. We instead explained in footnotes that we did runs of 40-120
topics of the half million abstracts, and 20-80 topics for the c. 19,000
women's history abstracts, then reviewed which seemed to be most useful to
understanding each corpus. This would be one example of where data
analysis relies on judgment as much as science.
{{% /notation %}}

We identified this broad field of women's history by included abstracts
that ranked highly in women's history topics from our initial topic
modeling runs; those that were published in women's studies or women's
history journals; and those that the AHL/HA databases had given the
terms of "women," "woman," or "gender" as a subject heading.[^6]
Together, our combination of subject word, topic model, and women's
studies journals resulted in identification of about 6% of abstracts \--
30,891\-- as being substantially focused on women's history.

{{% notation title="Figure 0a. Change over Time in topic of Race in Historical Abstracts" %}}

This chart, which did not make the final cut for the original article, gives an example of what topic modeling could show about change over time.The topic area that I labeled “Race” has the mostly likely words listed at top of chart and traces its increase from 1985-2005 as a proportion of all historical publications. This chart was created from a 400-topic topic modeling run of all abstracts in order to get to this level of specificity.

{{% notation title="Figure 0b. Sample Basic Topic Labels on Twenty-Topic Analysis of c. 19,000 Gender Abstracts" %}}

This table shows one topic modeling analysis of the c. 19.000 abstracts identified as related to women’s history. Because we did not focus on detailed topics for the bulk of the article, I labeled topics mostly for my own ease of identification (ie: I had two topics related to literature, and did not parse the fine differences between them for this essay). Creating a representative topic label involved parsing each list of likely words and looking at the articles with the highest percentage of text relating to each topic. If I wrote this today, I would crowd source the topic labels with multiple domain experts and provide an online supplement with transparent labels on each topic that showed areas of agreement and disagreement.

**Women's History in the Field at Large**

{{% notation title="Introductory Arguments" %}}
In retrospect, I could have punched up
this opening paragraph to better convey the excitement of some of our
findings. I suspect that, with such new methodologies, I was wary about
stepping too far away from what I could prove to adopt a more
conversational, or even slightly polemical, authorial voice.
{{% /notation %}}

The amount of scholarship on women and gender within the historical
profession has, not surprisingly, grown since 1985. Our analysis shows
that this growth has neither been steady over time, nor have particular
historical time periods and regions seen equal amounts of women's
history scholarship. Judging by an array of word counts, male figures
still remain the overwhelming focus of historical study. In addition,
several scholars have suggested that women's history disproportionately
focuses on very recent and on U.S. history topics. Here we show that
some of this concentration may actually be more a reflection of general
scholarly trends than specific to the field of women's history.


{{% notation title="(Not A Good) Surprise!" %}}
One of the most surprising findings was
that even by 2005, women's history content was still a single digit
percentage of all publication abstract content. I checked these numbers ten different ways
because I would have guessed that women's history content accounted for
closer to 25%; undoubtedly women's historians were overrepresented in
my own professional networks. I also asked a dozen-plus women's and
non-women's historians to guess the percent of article publications over
the past two decades that focused in some way on women's history. Pretty
uniformly, they guessed closer to 50% than the reality of 10%.
{{% /notation %}}

Publications related to women's history have been increasing since the
1980s. Figure 1 shows that women's history articles accounted for about
4% of all abstracts in 1985, and grew to about 8% by 2005. Some of this
relative growth resulted from an increase in absolute numbers of women's
history publications and some from a decline in the overall number of
historical articles. In 1985, about 27,500 historical articles were
abstracted in AHL and HA. Of these, about 1,058 related to women's
history. By the second half of the 1990s, women's history articles began
leveling off at the 1,500 per-year mark, while history articles overall
continued to decline \-- to about 19,000 by 2005.

{{% notation title="So Little Women's History" %}}
Looking back on this, I’m still surprised at the low percentage of abstracts that contain any substantive content on women’s history. I would love to repeat this to look at 2006-2020 to see whether the percentage of women’s history content has changed in the last decade and a half.

{{% /notation %}}


{{% notation title="Complicating Trajectories" %}}
I provided multiple ways for readers to
engage with data and tried to answer the questions that might come up
from the data presentation. One of the important issues when looking at
absolute numbers was how increases in women's history publications
related to changed overall publication numbers.
{{% /notation %}}

Despite overall increases, the growth rate of women's history abstracts
seems to have slowed significantly by the second half of the 1990s; the
small relative increases after that are due to an overall decrease in
historical abstracts generally, not to an increase in absolute numbers
of women's history abstracts. Do we interpret this as a positive:
women's history is becoming a bigger part of history? Or, given that
women's history-related abstracts still only account for, at most, 8% of
all history article abstracts, is the slowdown in absolute numbers of
women's history scholarship a cause for concern? At the very least, we
can quantitatively confirm that women's history is not anywhere near to
a majority of publications.

{{% notation title="Making Charts Legible and The Rise of Gender" %}}
In the article's
original version, this figure was expressed as "Frequency in \_\_ words"
which produced what looked like a declining curve. For the revision, we
inverted the chart to be a more user-friendly by calculating frequency per
1000 words, which created an upward curve that reflected the increased use of "gender" as a descriptive term. This was one way we tried to
make the charts, figures, and math accessible to historians.


{{< figure src="/img/blocknewman-fig1.jpg" caption="OLD Figure 2\: Frequency of Mentions of \"Gender\" in Abstracts from 1985-2005" >}}
I tried to repeatedly remind readers that this was an analysis of
abstracts, and so one step removed from the articles themselves. This
was particularly important when analyzing the word frequency of
"gender." I suspect that the dramatic rise of the term "gender" in
abstracts reflected shifting disciplinary jargon and may overstate a
shift in the content and approach to women's history.
{{% /notation %}}

While women's history articles have been increasing since 1985, their
content (or at least the identification of their content) has changed
dramatically over time. Most strikingly, the usage of the word "gender"
increased exponentially (See Figure 2). In 1985, "gender" occurred less
than 1 in every 10,000 words in abstracts. By 2005, "gender" occurred in
about every 1,250 words -- an eight-fold increase. In comparison, the
use of the word "women" grew by only 33% over this period. As most
women's historians know, the discussion of "women" quickly took a back
seat in the late 1980s and early 1990s to the use of "gender" in
historical scholarship.

{{< figure src="/img/blocknewmanfig1.png" title="Figure 1:" caption="Women's History Abstracts as Percent of Overall Abstracts versus Time." alt="Line chart showing the percent of women's history abstracts over time." >}}

{{% notation title="Analysis of Gender in Women's History" %}}
Beyond tracing the
historiography related to gender and the shifts toward cultural, rather
than social, histories in many circles, I also wanted to note that there
were costs to this beyond just a terminological shift. "Gender" wound up displacing what
may have been more overtly feminist classifications like sexism,
patriarchy, etc. To be clear, gender was a radical and empowering
analytic tool for many women's historians (myself included) in the
1990s. But looking back, I wonder if it gained traction in part because
it could seem less challenging to the status quo. I could imagine a
contemporary parallel to scholarship related to "race" versus
"white supremacy," terms that may address similar issues but carry very
different valences.
{{% /notation %}}

Some of this expansive use of "gender" undoubtedly reflects the
introduction of the term as a powerful analytic category in the
1980s.[^7] Attention to gender undoubtedly also reflects (and helped to
produce) a shift toward cultural histories of power relations, rather
than social histories of women's lives.[^8] Indeed, the frequency of the
word "cultural" doubled between 1985-2005, while the word "social" saw a
steady (though not as dramatic) downturn. It may also be that
abstracters are relying more comfortably on "gender" as a catchall
explanation of complex arguments about status and power that might have
been classified with other terms a decade earlier.[^9] Word frequency
statistics bear this out: words such as "patriarchy" and "sexism" show
no significant increase over this time period, and "feminism" shows
little increase after the 1980s.[^10] Perhaps this reflects less
attention to terms that might be seen by mainstream readers as more
strident versions of feminist history: "gender" has been naturalized to
a generic identifier less associated with activism (witness the regular
appearance of "gender" as a checkbox category on institutional forms),
whereas "patriarchy" and "sexism" still carry the imprint of a
particular activist movement.[^11]

{{% notation title="More Abstract Research" %}}
I would love to see a study of how
women's, gender, and sexuality histories are described in more recent
abstracts. Anecdotally, it seems that more historical publications
are requiring abstracts, so it would be enlightening to analyze
author-produced abstracts to see how they might compare to
database-produced ones.
{{% /notation %}}

Like the percentage of women's history abstracts generally, the
increasing use of the word, "gender," also leveled off by the mid-1990s.
We certainly hope that this does not mean that women's and gender
histories have already seen their heyday. A more positive interpretation
may be that women's history is becoming more integrated into diverse
topics, so that the women's history content is not fully explained or
easily identified in brief abstracts. It may also be possible that as
women's history becomes mainstream history, abstractors see less need to
mark such scholarship as focusing on women.

{{% notation title="Thanks, Joan" %}}
As any historian who was around in the 1990s can attest, Joan Scott’s conceptualization of gender was incredibly influential, and that shift toward looking at power relationships, not just women’s lived experiences, is very clear in this figure.

{{% notation title="Big Questions" %}}
Paragraphs like this displays my own interests in
the structure of the academy, not just its intellectual products. At the
time I wrote this article, institutional efforts aimed at addressing the continued
marginalization of various underrepresented minorities in academia were
just ramping up. I continue to believe that any analysis of scholarship
requires simultaneous attention to the structural conditions under which
that scholarship is produced. For instance, if I wrote this paragraph
now, when I'm much more aware of trans issues, I probably would not
refer to women's historians as "female" without qualification. My recent
work on racism and sexism in a popular scholarly database extends this
kind of analysis (Sharon Block, "Erasure, Misrepresentation, and
Confusion: Shortcomings of JSTOR Topics on Women's and Race Histories,"
*Digital Humanities Quarterly*, 14:1 (2020)
[[http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/1/000448/000448.html](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/1/000448/000448.html)
{{% /notation %}}

Still, this leveling off also raises several questions for women's
historians and the profession more generally. First, what is an
appropriate ultimate level of women's history publications within
historical journals? Can we numerically quantify when women's history
has "succeeded" and is suitably represented in historical publications?
Should attention to women appear in half of all historical studies?
Should a certain percent of studies include a feminist or gendered
analysis? Second are more profession-based questions: do publication
levels fairly reflect the percentage of women's historians? If not, are
there material factors -- likely related to women's place in the
profession \-- that might account for any discrepancy? Women's
historians are, of course, not all women, but they are
disproportionately likely to be female, and thus the field is more
impacted by professional equity issues than many other thematic
fields.[^12]

{{% notation title="Simple Finds Can Be Powerful" %}}
The next two paragraphs are a basic
word frequency analysis that is, to my mind, really powerful proof of
the degree of marginalization of women's history in historical
publishing. Some might argue that the word "women" appearing more
frequently than men shows the over-representation of women's history,
but it is clear that women's appearance is notable in ways that men's is
not in historical scholarship. The analysis of gendered pronouns
suggests that men are still the overwhelming focus of historical
publications.
{{% /notation %}}

Moreover, the overall increase in work on women's history does not
translate into equitable treatment of women and men in historical
studies. Women do receive more attention as a group or subject of study
in overall abstracts. The word "women" is used almost six times as often
as the word "men." This likely reflects the scholarly interest in women
as a category versus the appearance of individual men as incidental
subjects of historical inquiry, without analytic attention to gender
identity.

Footnote 3 notes that we undertook standard
pre-processing, such as removing stopwords from the text we were
analyzing. However, after a few topic modeling runs, we realized that
many standard stopword lists include gendered pronouns as stopwords (for
example, http://xpo6.com/list-of-english-stop-words/), which prevents
and analysis of their presence as a proxy for the degree to which
abstracts focused on men versus women. Keeping these pronouns in the
processed text allowed us to confirm that men were still overwhelmingly
the focus of publication abstracts.
{{% /notation %}}

But what about attention to individual male and female subjects? The
comparative use of some objective and possessive personal pronouns,
"her," "hers," "him," and "his," makes clear that individual men are
still implicitly the focus of the majority of historical scholarship.
Together, all of these pronouns are used over 200,000 times in the half
million abstracts. Yet only 14% of these uses are for "her" or "hers."
While women, as a category, are a subject (perhaps even an
over-essentialized subject) of analysis, historical scholarship still
appears to be largely focusing on men's activities as a matter of course
-- not necessarily to analyze men as gendered beings, but as default
individuals of study.

{{% notation title="Masculinity" %}}
At the time, masculinity studies seemed to be both on
the rise and controversial; some feminist scholars felt that women still
should be the focus of the field. Hence this paragraph confirming its
rise and gently weighing in to reject the idea that scholarly focus has
to be a zero sum game. While writing this article, I focused on
presenting clear and convincing data findings. If I wrote the article
now, I would foreground my opinions on the field more, and present more
potentially controversial perspectives on the implications of the data
findings. Of course, it is much easier to do this with a track record of
digital history publications behind me, not to mention another decade of
seniority in the profession.
{{% /notation %}}

Nevertheless, analytic studies of masculinity studies have unequivocally
been on the rise.[^13] The appearance of the term "masculinity" shows a
dramatic trajectory --from a virtually non-existent frequency of\`1 in
about every 90,000 words in 1985, to appearing more than once every 2000
words by the year 2000. This upswing reflects the ways that historical
articles have begun to focus critically on men beyond their incidental
appearance. This increase likely suggest a more widespread interest in
fully understanding all aspects of gendered power dynamics. But does the
increase in masculinity studies relate to the slowing expansion in
women's history in the new millennium? We should be careful not to posit
a zero-sum-game of interest in gender-related studies, but it may be
useful to consider the relationship between feminist, women-focused, and
broadly-constituted gender histories.

{{% notation title="Regionalism" %}}
Historians love regional differentiation. Because
*America: History and Life* (AHL) focuses on North America and
*Historical Abstracts* (HA) focuses (theoretically) on everywhere else,
it made sense to compare the two databases. I was a little surprised
that women's history pretty consistently appeared more frequently in
North American-focused publications.
{{% /notation %}}

Turning to a regional analysis of history abstracts shows that a higher
percentage of articles are being published on women in North America
than in the rest of the world. Almost twice as many North American
abstracts as Non-North American abstracts include either "woman,"
"women," or "gender" somewhere in the entry (almost 10% v. about 5%,
respectively). As Table 1 shows, a variety of words relating directly to
women are almost twice as likely to appear in North American abstracts
as non-North American abstracts.

{{% notation title="Figure Presentation" %}}
I spent a lot of time thinking about how to present tables and charts in ways that would be most accessible for women’s historians. All of the charts are, I hope, pretty straight forward. Still, as a colleague emailed when this article was originally published, “it's a good thing I know the author because otherwise those charts would scare me to death!!” A divide between quantitative and qualitative comfort probably continues to exist. In the past decade, however, scholars have become much more comfortable with visual representations of data, which are now more readily producible without particular software expertise. Perhaps non-numeric graphics would have reduced that knee-jerk math/data fear that some women’s historians felt when viewing the many tables and graphs in the article.

{{% notation title="Change Over Time" %}}
For most of the trends I discussed, I aimed to
break them down to see what changed over time. It was a tricky endeavor
-- and I did not always find the best balance -- to providing accurate
information and offering a readable narrative. This has been a challenge
for me in various data mining and digital humanities settings: how to
present quantitative findings, particularly of huge corpuses, in ways
that make the findings a tool for analysis, not the end result. This
piece sometimes erred on the findings over argument side.
{{% /notation %}}

These word choices mark the larger presence of women's history abstracts
within North American history overall. Women's history abstracts are
twice as big a proportion of North American abstracts (almost 9%) as
non-North American abstracts (slightly more than 4%). This has been
fairly consistent over time of publication: in 1985, women's
history-focused abstracts accounted for over 6% of all North American
abstracts, but just over 2% of non-North American abstracts. In 2005,
women's history abstracts had expanded to almost 11% of North American
abstracts and 6% of non-North-American abstracts. We can view these
increases as positive or negative trends: on the negative side, North
American women's history was about the same proportion of it regional
field in 1985 as non-North American women's history was two decades
later. On the positive side, the amount of women's history on non-North
American topics has tripled in two decades.

{{% notation title="Noting Method" %}}
Footnote 14 offers details on our data analysis
process as well as acknowledging our inability to include all regions in
our analysis.
{{% /notation %}}

Table 2 compares the regional breakdown of overall abstracts and women's
history abstracts in more detail. North American abstracts account for
just over 1/3 of overall abstracts, but more than half of abstracts on
women's history.[^14] In contrast, several non-North American geographic
regions are particularly underrepresented in women's history. Work on
Eastern Europe/Soviet regions shows the biggest discrepancy, accounting
for almost 17% of all abstracts, but less than 7% of women's history
abstracts. Western Europe and, to a lesser degree, South Asia, are both
overrepresented in women's history percentages in their fields.

{{% notation title="Why the West" %}}
Read now, this is a rather weak paragraph on the
reasons for the lack of attention to historical topics outside of the
West. Today, I would be more direct about racism, xenophobia, American
exceptionalism, and the structure of the publishing industry. Still, I
will give myself a little credit for trying to point to the ways that
women's history publications related to the treatment of women in
academia.
{{% /notation %}}

Source availability, feminist activism, sexism, and acceptance of
women's history as a legitimate field of study all contribute to these
regional variations. In the case of Eastern Europe, scholars have
already suggested that such underrepresentation results from a
significant "infrastructural vacuum and institutional resistance" to
women's history. This is, perhaps, the case in other regions as well.
And the reverse may also be true -- it would be worth investigating
whether North American historians or journal editors are comparatively
more supportive of women's history.[^15]

{{% notation title="On Formating" %}}

This was a hard chart to figure out how to format. I wanted to make clear that the “Regions outside of North America” was a breakdown of “Non-North America (HA).” In retrospect (and with better presentation design tools available a decade later) two side-by-side graphic representations may have worked better. Nevertheless, I really value the detail in this table that makes clear how North American and Western Europe topics overwhelmingly dominated both women’s history and general historical publications.

{{% notation title="Women's History Is Too Modern?" %}}
When I researched and wrote this
article, there seemed to be significant discussion and debate about
whether women's historians only wanted to do 20^th^-century scholarship,
and how this was a major flaw in the field. Accordingly, I analyzed the
chronological spread of women's history. AHL and HA categorized the
scholarship it abstracted by time period, so I could compare women's
history's chronological foci to general historical publications'
chronological foci.
{{% /notation %}}

We might think that the overrepresentation of North American scholarship
on women's history can be explained by chronology. If women's history
tends to be disproportionately concentrated on the most recent
centuries, a country with a relatively abbreviated early history would
be likely to have an increased proportion of articles related to women's
history. However, when we compare time periods addressed in women's
history abstracts and overall abstracts from c. 1450-20^th^ century, it
does not seem that women's history is significantly more
recently-focused than the profession as a whole.

{{% notation title="Analytic Choices" %}}
This table offers a good example of the many
expertise-based choices that are necessary for a thoughtful analysis. It
would have been simpler to provide a chart where each row was a century.
AHL and HA provided the years on which an article focused, but as in all
data analysis, I had to make decisions about how to aggregate and
present it meaningfully, such as how to group work that crossed decades
(see footnote 16). For instance, scholarship repeatedly focused on the
1880s-1920s, which does not fit into a category of a single
century. I also decided to break out the pre- and post-1945 time periods
because they showed that the women's history was more under-represented
in the pre-1945 period. Each figure in this article represents extensive
pre-analysis of the data, re-running and re-categorizing with the goal
of best highlighting and coherently presenting the most important
findings.
{{% /notation %}}

As Table 3 shows, the twentieth century accounts for the overwhelming
majority of all historical abstracts from c. 1450-onward.[^16] However,
women's history abstracts are not disproportionately focused there-- if
anything women's history is slightly *underrepresented* in
twentieth-century scholarship. Work exclusively on the twentieth century
accounted for about 57% of women's-history-focused articles, and about
63% of overall articles. Still, this analysis supports Judith M.
Bennett's conclusion that women's history and overall historical
scholarship focus primarily on post-1800 time periods.[^17]

{{% notation title="Nuancing Current Historiography" %}}
Judith Bennett's work had rightly
impacted on how scholars understood the state of the field of
women's history. Adding to her contention that women's history
disproportionately studies modern time periods, we found that women's
history publications most focused on the nineteenth and
turn-of-the-twentieth century.
{{% /notation %}}

Our larger analysis adds to Bennett's by teasing out some of the
differences between post-c. 1450 women's history and scholarship more
broadly. Rather than unrelentingly focusing on the very recent past,
women's history abstracts focus more on the nineteenth century than does
overall scholarship--about 16% of women's history abstracts but just 12%
of general abstracts focus exclusively on the nineteenth century.
Likewise, women's history articles are more likely to focus on turn of
the twentieth century period than does general scholarship (6.7% v.
3.7%), which focuses more broadly on the first half of the twentieth
century.[^18]

{{% notation title="Graphic Representation and Transparency" %}}

Here too, I could see a graphic representation working better to show the distribution of time periods in historical abstracts. I am not opposed to precise quantitative tables, but think that graphics generally allow for a more clear and immediate impression, especially for an audience who is not particularly quantitatively oriented. For Table 3, seeing the relative value may have been more important than knowing the size of a category to the 1/10th of a percentage point. At the time, I had hoped that other scholars would pick up on this research and further refine its findings, so decided that exact percentages would be more useful for those interested in pursuing further analysis.The asterisk below the table is another example of my efforts at transparency and clarity and footnotes 13, 16, and 22 offer further details on the classification process we used to analyze chronology.

{{% /notation %}}

|3 or more Centuries|3.9%|5.6%|

*Twentieth-century percentages include 1900-1999 dates, as well as 1900-1945, and post-1945 categories.


{{% notation title="Where's the Sweep?" %}}
The finding that women's histories undertook
fewer chronologically sweeping narratives intrigued me. I suspect that
this could be due to women's historians facing decades of accusations of
transhistoricism and critical accusations of wrongly undertaking
"activist" history, as well as to the developmental stage of the field.
It may also reflect the degree to which women's historians have been
accepted as intellectual authorities in the profession.
{{% /notation %}}

Bennett has also explicitly encouraged feminist scholars to avoid taking
refuge within our historical era of expertise. However, women's
historians seem reluctant to write across time periods: overall
scholarship was much more likely to focus on three or more centuries
than was women's history.[^19] It may be that women's historians,
already all-too-often battling the perception of "advocacy" or
"ahistoric" scholarship, take great pains to stick closely to our
historically-specific evidence. Yet we risk this making us timid about
claiming expertise across wide swaths of time or place, and in so doing,
we may be limiting the significance of our findings.

{{% notation title="Basic Chronologies" %}}
Paragraphs like this, that narrate expected
chronological differences across regions, are not particularly exciting
or surprising. But presenting basic data findings still strikes me as
important to document. Today, I would add a discussion of how the start
of North American abstracts in the c.1450 time period reflects a
problematic settler colonial approach, not a chronological reality. (See
for instance, Juliana Barr, "There's no such thing as 'Prehistory': What
the Longue Durée of Caddo and Pueblo History Tells Us about Colonial
America," *The William and Mary Quarterly* 74, no. 2 (April 2017):
203--40.
{{% /notation %}}

As we might expect, non-North American general abstracts are much more
likely to focus on earlier time periods than are North American
abstracts. Less than 4% of North American abstracts focus on the
c.1450-1799 time period, compared to 12% of non-North American
abstracts. In addition, non North-American women's history is actually
*more* likely to focus on earlier time periods than general scholarship:
more than 15% of non-North American women's history abstracts focus
exclusively on c.1450-1799. Correspondingly, non-North American women's
history actually focused less on the 20^th^-century than did overall
non-North American abstracts (51% v. 69%).

{{% notation title="To Summarize" %}}
My writing tends to signpost, such as in this
conclusion to a sub-section. In a historical journal piece that involves
quantitative data with which some readers might have not fully engaged,
I particularly wanted to narratively flag the section's findings.
{{% /notation %}}

The limits of AHL and HA databases restrict us from including ancient
and medieval history in this analysis. However, within these
limitations, women's history is not disproportionately more
recently-focused than history as a whole. Rather than women's historians
abandoning earlier time periods, non-North American women's history
appears to have focused more on c.1450-1800 topics than has the field at
large. Still, because women's history is a bigger percentage of North
American history -- which is the biggest overall field \-- these
chronologically earlier studies may not seem to hold as noticeable a
place in women's history publications.

{{% notation title="Topic Modeling Women's History" %}}
This section identifies and looks
at the content of the publication abstracts that included notable
content on women's history. I envisioned the article going from broad
(all of historical abstracts) narrowing to a smaller subset of women's
history, and then ending with an even narrower in-depth analysis of one
sub-theme within women's history. I thought this would show potential
uses of data mining from varied vantage points.
{{% /notation %}}

Focusing on the topics that account for women's history within all
historical abstracts confirms that women's history publications make up
a larger part of North American history abstracts then those focused on
the rest of the world. Our topic model run of the half million abstracts
identified seven major subject areas focused primarily on women and
gender (Table 4). Within every area, women's history made up a bigger
part of North American-focused scholarship. Thus, part of the reason
that U.S. women's history can seem to dominate overall women's history
overall is due to women's history's bigger place within North American
history than within other regions.

{{% notation title="Understanding Topic Modeling Content" %}}
One of the confusing
aspects of topic modeling is that it analyzes topics within the content
overall. So a single abstract could be assigned numerous topics. Some
readers did not understand how 3% of abstract content could be women's
history, while 6% of the number of abstracts included a focus on women's
history. I tried to explain this in detail here but recognize that how
topic modeling works was not intuitive for many readers. Footnote 20
specifies the different numbers of topics (40, 80, 120) we tried out in
topic modeling runs of this corpus; we tried to be as transparent as
possible about the our technical choices without bogging down the text
with those details.
{{% /notation %}}

Women's history-focused topics account for almost 3% of the content of
all historical abstracts.[^20] Because topic modeling identifies the
*content overall*, rather than counting each abstract that mentions a
women's history topic as being exclusively about women's history, this
c. 3% represents the content of all scholarship that focuses on women's
history to the exclusion of other topics. In other words, topic modeling
can separate out the parts of women's history abstracts that
simultaneously address other scholarly subjects (e.g.: politics,
religion, labor) to focus exclusively on the women's history language.
Thus, 6% of all abstracts may have significant women's history content,
but only about 3% *of the text* of all abstracts focus explicitly on
women's history -- concretely showing the full integration of women's
history with other thematic areas of study.

{{% notation title="Women's History Topics" %}}
Looking back, these women's history topics
look rather staid. I don't know if that was a result of the work being
done, how it was abstracted, or how I, as domain expert, interpreted the
topic model results. I could imagine that in 2021, I might focus on
different topic words in labeling each topic because our collective
jargon has changed over time.
{{% /notation %}}

Table 4 explores these thematic areas of women's history within
historical scholarship. Work on feminism and suffrage is one of the
largest topical categories, followed closely by scholarship on more
intimate details of women's lives: families and kinship, and marriage
and sexuality. Literary subjects -- whether biographies of notable women
or literary approaches to women's history -- are also well represented.
How are we to evaluate this broad variation of fields that make up
women's history scholarship? Should there be more scholarship overtly on
feminism or less on personal lives -- however we might define those two
categories? Rather than presuming to dictate what women's history should
consist of, we note that even at this high level vantage point, there is
a significant spread of topics across multiple aspects of women's lives.
We also note that abstracts likely focus more on methodologies and
source than full text, which may account for the prominent percentage of
literature and biography-related content.

from the data mining results did not get lost in the quantitative
details, so offer a narrative summary here.

I debated how much to explain about the probabilistic topic modeling process, about labeling of topics, etc. Here I decided to just include the topic labels I added to topic modeling topics as a domain expert, rather than including lists of most frequent terms in each topic. If I wrote this now, I might redo this table into a visual to make the regional differences in thematic foci more easily scannable.

There is no doubt that women's history accounts for a diverse and
growing proportion of historical scholarship. Within this growth,
however, its rate of increase has been slowing. An increased focus on
"gender" in abstracts partly represents changed scholarly interests, but
likely also reflects a changed shorthand for women's history. Even
though references to women, as a group, far outnumber mention of men as
a category for analysis, the overwhelming majority of abstracts still
talk about individual men, not women, as historical subjects.
Regionally, by multiple measures, women's history holds a significantly
larger place in the North American and Western European historical
fields than in many other regions. However, women's history's
seemingly-disproportionate focus on more recent time periods appears to
be a reflection of the historical profession as a whole. In the next
section, we focus more in depth on women's history abstracts to further
analyze the extent to which these trends relate to women's history
rather than larger trends within the profession.

**The Field of Women's History**

{{% notation title="Section Intro" %}}
One of the values of comparing all
historical abstracts to women's history abstracts is the
ability to pinpoint where variations occur -- if women's history
publications follow or depart from more general trends in historical
publishing.
{{% /notation %}}

Here we explore the 30,891 abstracts that focused significantly on
women's history, exploring how the picture changes when we look within
women's history abstracts, rather than at women's history as part of the
historical field as a whole. We show that women's historians speak with
a regionally-shared language, and that some regional variations in
content relate more to the place of women's history within various
subfields than the content of women's history scholarship. We continue
to dissect the notion that women's history has developed a
twentieth-century bias and suggest that it is more complicated than a
simple shift toward scholarly emphasis on the most recent time periods.
In terms of absolute numbers, women's history has not turned away from
c.1450-1799 time periods; rather work on the post-1800 period has
increased, therefore changing the overall chronological balance.

{{% notation title="Revisiting Word Frequencies" %}}
This paragraph and associated table
offer an opportunity to directly compare overall abstracts to women's
history abstracts. The larger focus on women-related terms in North
American-focused histories largely disappears within women's history
abstracts.
{{% /notation %}}

Table 1 showed that women-related words appeared far more frequently in
North American abstracts than in abstracts on the rest of the world.
This regional difference largely disappears *within the 30,891* women's
history abstracts (Table 5), suggesting a trans-regionally shared
language with which experts talk about women's history. Thus, the broad
regional differences in overall word frequencies appear to have more to
do with the place of women's history in different regions and less to do
with the amount of work being done within women's history. Still, some
of this lack of variation is likely due to the flattening of complex
issues into abstract-friendly terms, and it does not mean that abstracts
that focus on women's history in different regions and time periods take
identical approaches to the field.

{{% notation title="The West Dominates" %}}
The structure of these databases suggests the
disproportionate focus on the United States (and Canada), and I noted
this structural overemphasis in the following paragraphs. I would hope
that the most recent decade of women's history publications would show
less dominance of North American (and secondarily Western European)
regional foci.
{{% /notation %}}

Within women's history abstracts, we can see an array of regional
transformations between 1985 and 2005. In the mid-1980s, women's history
was significantly dominated by North American scholarship, which made up
close to 60% of all abstracts. But by the mid-1990s and continuing
through the first years of the new millennium, women's history had
become equally focused on regions outside of North America.[^21] Of
course, equality between one continent, made of two nations, and the
rest of the world is not exactly parity, but it does suggest the
expansion of women's history beyond its earlier regional foci.

{{% notation title="Interrogating Data" %}}
Anyone who has undertaken quantitative
analysis knows how important it is to think carefully about what the
data shows. At first glance, Figure 3 looked like 2 parallel lines
increasing, but the rate of increase was nearly double for Western
Europe as for North American women's history abstracts. I extensively
analzed each figure that made it into the article (and many more that didn't) to be sure all
findings were both accurate and significant.
{{% /notation %}}

Western Europe was overwhelmingly the largest non-U.S. regional focus of
women's history abstracts (Figure 3). While both areas' article
abstracts increased their absolute numbers fairly steadily over the
twenty year period (with some leveling in the new millennium), this was
a much bigger proportional increase for Western Europe -- it increased
about 100% over its starting numbers, compared to only about a 50%
increase for North America. So while women's historians may be turning
to non-Western regions, the attention to Western history is still
continuing to increase substantially.

{{% notation title="Marking Parallel Trends" %}}
If the article were structured differently, I might have had a
section analyzing the many areas of change that seemed to level off
after the early-to-mid 1990s. I bring it up repeatedly throughout the
article, but it could be an interesting focused analysis to think about broad
changes in the field of historical publishing.
{{% /notation %}}

Outside of Western Europe and North America, each regional field's
women's history abstracts likewise increased over time (Figure 4). One
of the most dramatic increases occurred in East Asian history: in 1985,
it was barely the fourth highest number of abstracts; by the mid-1990s,
it had more than doubled to have the highest number of abstracts of any
regional field of women's history outside of North America and Western
Europe. Most regions seem to be declining in the first half decade of
the twenty-first century, with African women's history abstracts showing
the largest drop. Overall, scholarship still increased in each of these
regions, showing the most pronounced gains occurring in the first half
of the 1990s and then leveling after 2000.

{{% notation title="On Presentation and Percentages" %}}

I thought about using percentages to convey these frequencies because readers may be more used to seeing percentages, but I wanted this table directly comparable to Table 1, and Table 1’s percentages would have been as small as 0.009% which did not seem particularly reader-friendly.

{{% notation title="Return to Chronology" %}}
While the question of which time periods of
women's history received adequate attention may no longer animate the
field, at the time I wrote the article it was a significant concern.
Employing a topic modeling analysis of a giant corpus seemed like an
ideal application to test hypotheses about women's history publication
trends.
{{% /notation %}}

The chronological breakdown of women's history has recently received a
great deal of analytic attention. While abstracts on all time periods of
women's history have increased along broadly similar trajectories since
1985 (See Figure 5), the most marked increase has been in nineteenth --
not twentieth-century \-- women's history.[^22] In fact, the numbers of
twentieth-century women's history abstracts actually increased the
*least* of any time period between 1985 and 2005. Twentieth-century
women's history abstracts grew to 1.4 times their 1985 number, while
c.1450-1699 century abstracts grew to 1.7 times; eighteenth-century grew
to 1.9 times and nineteenth century grew to 2.1 times their 1985 numbers
by 2005. Alternatively, looked at as a percentage of women's history
abstracts each year, twentieth-century women's history has actually
declined -- from 75% of all women's history abstracts in 1985, to 68% in
2005.

{{% notation title="Crowded Data" %}}
I struggled to present these six trend lines in a legible format. Color would have been easier, of course. I decided on two charts of regional variation (Part I and Part II) because including Western Europe and North America with all other regions would have left those other regions illegibly squished together due to their substantially lower numbers (ranges of c. 10-70 v. c. 200-900).

{{% notation title="It Isn't All About The Now" %}}
I was surprised to find that
twentieth-century women's historical publication was not
disproportionally crowding out other women's history; a comparison
to historical publishing overall presents a more complex picture of
chronological spread. This is yet another reminder that finding and
reporting data is usually a multi-step process of investigating various
permutations, looking for supporting explanations in related data sets,
and above all, being careful to interrogate and cross-check all
findings.
{{% /notation %}}

Thus, twentieth-century women's history publications *have not been*
increasingly dominating the scholarship on post-1450 women's history.
But there are several reasons why women's history may still appear to be
disproportionately focused on twentieth-century history. First,
abstracts on twentieth-century history overall far outnumber all other
time periods put together, meaning far more absolute numbers of women's
history publications on the twentieth century. Second, overall abstracts
that are identifiably on the twentieth century have declined fairly
significantly since 1985 -- from a range of 16,000 abstracts/year for
20th-century scholarship in the late 1980s to a low of below 12,000 by
the twenty-first century. In contrast, all other time periods have held
steady or declined only slightly. Thus, even though women's history on
the nineteenth century has increased the most, women's history has
become a much larger *percentage* of overall twentieth century
scholarship than of other time periods.

{{% notation title="An Alternative Article" %}}
I have occasionally thought that I could
have turned the discussion of chronology into its own article, with more
in-depth analysis, examples of scholarship, and narrative explorations.
An article with a clear and linear argument that used data mining to
make a single point may have been more appealing to many women's
historians. But I had an interest in showing the range of results from
large scale data mining as a proof of concept kind of approach, in the
hopes that others would build on this kind of methodological work.
{{% /notation %}}

{{% notation title="Presentation, Yet Again" %}}

Here, too, I might have chosen to smooth the data somewhat, or perhaps present this with better graphics. Looking back, I’m not sure how crucial this figure is other than to show roughly similar trends. I wonder if the larger variations in 18th-century scholarship relates to its smaller overall numbers of abstracts; at the time, I tried to look for an explanation of the big spike in 2002, but could not find a simple explanation.

{{% /notation %}}

{{< figure src="/img/Blocknewmanfig5.png" title="Figure 5:" caption="Percent of Women's History Abstracts withn Time period by Publication Date" alt="Graph of women's history abstracts within time period and publication date.">}}

This means that even though the twentieth century remains the largest
focus of history as a whole, it does not appear that women's history has
any more disproportionately focused on that time period; the increases
in 20^th^-century women's history have not outpaced the increases in
other time periods. Indeed, considering the limitations that face
historians of periods predating the twentieth century, women's and
gender historians have become increasingly creative in finding and
mining primary sources related to women throughout history.

{{% notation title="Moving to Topics" %}}
This section emphasizes the topical power of
topic modeling. Again, we tried to be transparent, so footnote 23 notes
how we combined some topics in a 40-topic topic model.
{{% /notation %}}

Thus far, we have focused on the amount, not the content, of women's
history abstracts. Table 6 identifies, through topic modeling, the broad
subject areas of study within women's history.[^23] In contrast to the
broad areas of women's history identified within the larger historical
canon (Table 4), the subjects within women's history clearly cover many
specific thematic fields. The largest topical area focuses, as does much
general historical work, on various regional and national specificities.
Other topics range from social to political to cultural to intellectual
histories. As Gerda Lerner noted in her study of U.S. history
scholarship, work on literary subjects (such as much of the Literature
and Biography topics) remains a substantial segment of women's history
publications.[^24]

{{% notation title="Topic Modeling Process Reminder" %}}
Because readers repeatedly seemed
perplexed over how topic models identify topics, we reiterated what we
are measuring with these topics, complete with examples, here.
{{% /notation %}}

It is also worth remembering that the topic model creates multiple
categories per abstract, so these topics measure the percentage of
*overall content* of the abstracts, not *individual topics per
abstract*. For instance, an abstract on labor and family in Latin
America would count toward each of those three subject/regional areas in
proportion to the number of words in that abstract that were
statistically assigned to each of these topics. Thus, rather than
marking each abstract with an exclusionary set of labels, each abstract
contributes to a variety of topical areas in proportion to the amount
that that abstract focuses on each area. This can produce more realistic
subject categorizations and challenge the sometimes-mainstream image of
women's history as not intrinsic to other subfields.

**Table 6: Broad Topic Areas in Women's History Abstracts**
|**Topic Area**|**% of text aaddressing**|
|----|----|
|Regional Focus (inc. colonialism/nationalism)|12.7%|
|Labor, Economics, Class|11.7%|
|Literature, Biography|11.0%|
|Sexuality, Reproduction|9.0%|
|Historiography, Reviews|6.4%|

{{% notation title="Return to Regionalism" %}}
I wanted to emphasize the regional
differences in topics. The differing terminologies used within regional
women's history abstracts struck me as an interesting insight into the
broad trends within each region's version of women's history. At the
same time, I'm now struck by how little race appears in this article;
given how focused "race" topics were on North American history
abstracts. I recall not wanting to be overly U.S.-focused, so may have
underplayed the topic, since it was not an easily comparable one. I
would hope that in 2021, the scholarship would support and even require
a more intersectional analysis.
{{% /notation %}}

There are some broad regional variations in these topics: Not
surprisingly, non-North American abstracts are more likely to focus on
regional issues than are North American abstracts, while Race, Slavery
and Civil Rights appear three times as often in relation to North
American abstracts. More specific regional differences suggest an array
of areas for future analysis. African women's history focuses less on
marriage and family than other regions, but words such as "power"
"status" and "traditional" occur comparatively frequently. Commentary on
religion was most common in Middle East women's history (about 19% of
the focus of its abstracts, compared to less than 6% for any other
region). Middle East history also focused strongly on the study of
feminism. East Asian history was most likely to focus on marriage and
families. Latin American women's histories focused more than most
regions on political movements, as well as labor and marriage. Eastern
Europe/Soviet abstracts were one of the most likely to reference
"tradition" and focus on inheritance and households. South Asia scholars
frequently addressed feminism and political movements, and were also the
most likely to use the word "cultural"\-- perhaps partly because of the
importance of literary and post-colonial scholars doing South Asian
women's history. Work in North American history was one of the least
likely to focus on marriage and family, and among the most likely to
focus on sexuality, race, labor, and the term "public." Finally, Western
Europe focused far more on families, households and status than did
North America.

{{% notation title="Analysis Attempt" %}}
This paragraph is a pretty week analysis of some
really interesting trends described in the previous paragraph. This is
the trade-off of a data survey piece: it is difficult to do a deep dive
into any one set of findings. There were moments when I thought this
article could be a short book -- one chapter on each area of findings
and analysis. But my own approach to scholarship favors jam-packed
research and condensed writing. I also, honestly, did not think I wanted
to invest so much into topic modeling -- I wanted to continue research
and publishing in colonial North American history. Ironically, my
subsequent monograph involved hand-coding c. 4000 documents, but
scholars repeatedly categorized it wrongly as a computerized data mining project.
{{% /notation %}}

Even though, as Table 5 showed, women's history abstracts use similar
levels of women-focused language, this more complicated analysis of what
women's historians address suggests that different thematic emphases
predominate in various regional specialties within women's history.
There are undoubtedly numerous reasons for these variations (e.g.,
source availability, disciplinary guidance), but it does seem that
women's historians are responding to their regions' particular
historiographic concerns.

{{% notation title="The Most Broad Topics" %}}
I thought it was interesting to compare the
largest four categories of topics, making up about one-third of all
topics, in very recent (post-1945) versus the most distant (pre-1800)
time periods. I do wonder if abstracters on early time periods are
likely to write more generally about subject matter than those who are
trying to distinguish the array of scholarship on recent history. This
is a question that a full text analysis of scholarship could help
answer: what shared disciplinary terms do women's historians use for
scholarship across versus within specific time periods?
{{% /notation %}}

In terms of chronologic comparisons, generalizable topics of study best
traversed chronologic distance. Tables 7 and 8 compare the largest
individual categories in distant and recent time periods.
Chronologically distant women's history abstracts seemed to focus on
more transhistoric topics, such as family and households, women, gender,
or religion. In contrast, three of the four biggest topics in post-1945
abstracts focus on issues particularly pertinent to twentieth-century
life, such as women's relation to political parties, civil rights, or
employment discrimination. Ironically, the specificity allowed by
twentieth-century sources may encourage more parochial topics;
distantly-focused women's historians may be more likely to focus on
topic areas that could be of broad scholarly applicability.[^25]

{{% notation title="Signposted Questions" %}}
Looking back, this is a bit of a cheat
paragraph. I begin to summarize the previous section's findings, and
then turn to an array of (unanswered) questions to raise issues about
those findings. I'm guessing I was tired and/or hitting my word limit by
this point in the essay, to be honest. Still, these are reasonable questions that
get at issues of systemic bias, structural impediments, and continue to
connect the scholarship we do to the lived experiences of being a
woman's historian.
{{% /notation %}}

To summarize, the field of women's history continues to expand in
multiple directions. Even though all regional areas of women's history
have increased since 1985, U.S. and Western Europe still dominate the
field. How do we begin to explain the complex factors that may have
accounted for regional variations in amount and subject of study? To
what degree are they about reception to these fields *by* women's
historians; reception within these regional fields *to* women's
historians, or artifacts of particular tipping-point moments in training
or individual scholarship? While an array of recent reflections on the
state of women's history has endorsed the need for the continued
internationalization of women's history, scholars might want to first
more fully explore the limiting factors that produce these variant
trends.

{{% notation title="Clear Concluding" %}}
More signposting to reiterate what we had
just showed. If I wrote this now, I hope I'd be more adventurous and
perhaps offer resolutions, specific areas for needed followup, etc.
Again, this shows the tension between presenting a data-mined overview
of the state of the field of women's history and diving deeply into
those findings.
{{% /notation %}}

{{% notation title="Time Period Topic Comparison" %}}

Because the relative amount of women’s history content published on various time periods had been such a concern in the field, I wanted to offer a broad comparison of topical content of the two most chronologically far apart time periods. I called these subject areas “categories” rather than “topics” to signal that I had combined multiple topic model topics to create each category title.

{{% /notation %}}

**Table 7: Top Four Categories for post-1945 Women's History Abstracts**
|----|----|
|11.5%|Economic Employment Disparities|
|8.3%|Gender and Identity|
|7.0%|Political Parties|
|5.1%|Civil Rights and Affirmative Action|

**Table 8: Top Four Categories for c.1450-1799 Women's History Abstracts**
|----|----|
|10.5%|Family and Households|
|9.2%|Women and Men|
|6.9%|Gender and Identity|
|6.5%|Religion|

In terms of the time periods covered by the AHL and HA databases, the
picture is a complicated one: women's history focuses on more recent
time periods, but no more so than the field as a whole. Indeed, by
several measures, twentieth-century women's history scholarship appears
to have increased less than some earlier time periods. But the
domination of overall twentieth-century scholarship can still leave
women's history looking like a very recently-focused enterprise.
Finally, a subject area analysis of women's history shows coverage of a
diverse range of historical subjects, with differing emphases along
lines of regional historiographic concerns. Despite these variations,
broad topic areas of c.1450-1800 scholarship could easily provide
productive intellectual connections to other chronologic times and
places, and we hope scholars will increasingly consider chronologically
and regionally broad thinking when doing women's history.

**Within Women's History: Case Study of Sexuality**

{{% notation title="Focus on Sex" %}}
Here I wanted to show the ways that topic modeling
could zero in on a particular subfield. I chose history of sexuality
because it was an area I knew well.
{{% /notation %}}

Historical studies of sexuality have developed, in part, out of work on
women and gender, and remain firmly related to the field.[^26] Here we
take sexuality as a case study to further explore the trends and
patterns revealed by topic modeling. We break down the broad subject
areas of sexuality histories, examine the degree to which studies in
sexuality topics vary across time periods and regions, and ask how the
topics within sexuality vary along these two axes. We suggest that both
the amount and content of sexuality histories appear to vary more by
region than by chronology.

{{% notation title="Continued Comparisons" %}}
Here, too, I thought it important to
compare findings with larger sets of women's history abstracts, to see
the extent to which these matched or departed from more general trends.
{{% /notation %}}

Like most women-related subjects, sexuality appeared to be discussed
substantially more in North American than in Non-North American
abstracts overall. Of more than a dozen explicitly sex-related terms,
only "prostitution" appeared more frequently in overall non-North
American abstracts-- and then, only slightly more often.[^27] More
informal (and less supposedly-scientific) terms on homosexuality show
some of the biggest regional differences: "Lesbian" and "gay" occur
three-to-five times more often in North American as non-North American
overall abstracts.

{{% notation title="Word Frequencies" %}}
This section paralleled the explorations in the
previous sections, beginning with word frequency analysis and moving
onto topic modeling. Even though word frequencies are a basic
computational methodology, I found them useful for comparing content, in
this case, across regional abstracts.
{{% /notation %}}

When we examine sexuality-related words in women's history abstracts
alone, much -- but not all \-- of these differences begin to disappear
(Table 9). For instance, "sex," "sexual" and "sexuality," combined,
appear in North American and non-North American women's history
abstracts roughly equally, even though they appeared almost twice as
often in overall North American abstracts as overall Non-North American
abstracts. Likewise, "homosexual" occurred almost evenly in and outside
of North American regions within women's history abstracts, even though
the term was almost twice as common in North American as non-North
American overall abstracts. Some terms for same-sex sexual behavior
remains unevenly distributed within women's history abstracts: "queer,"
"gay" and "lesbian" show some of the most stark regional differences.
Future research could explain the degree to which such variations
reflect differing historical subject foci and abstracting norms, whether
terms such as "queer" carry unacceptable meanings in some contexts or
language translations and, more generally, the complexity of differing
local and global understandings of same-sex sexuality. In contrast, and
following lower discrepancies in overall abstracts, "prostitution" and
"rape" appear more frequently in non-North American women's histories,
perhaps suggesting more overall attention to particular kinds of
(heterosexual?) transgressive sexual behavior outside of North America.

{{% notation title="Narrating Tables" %}}
It is always a balancing act as to how much to
narrate tables and figures. Because the figures and tables convey much
of the content of this piece, it seemed important to narrativize their
content, but that can also make for less-than-exciting text. Still, the
ability to clearly explain the significance of a table or figure is a
crucial skill for quantitative digital humanities scholars.
{{% /notation %}}

The sexuality--related subject content of women's history abstracts more
comprehensively shows the distribution of subject areas within history
of sexuality. Table 10 summarizes the five main sexuality-related topic
areas within a 40-topic breakdown, alongside the keywords that most
represent those topics. Together, these topics account for 9% of the
text of women's history abstracts. Work on sexuality generally, is the
largest topic, while work on same-sex sexual behavior and reproduction
are the smallest. The second largest category focuses on sexual
regulation and social control of sexuality, likely reflecting sexuality
study's longtime focus on transgressive behavior and use of legal
records for evidence on prohibited sexual practices.

{{% notation title="Useful, if not Exciting" %}}
This brief paragraph is an example of a
rather large set of findings in a not-so-exciting presentation. This
narrative of Figure 6 lays out regional differences in how scholars of
history of sexuality have approached the topic. This seemed to offer a
really useful understanding of the state of the field that I hoped
others might pick up on and further explore. Even though it seems brief
and straightforward, it took extensive domain knowledge and expertise to
thoughtfully classify the various topics within history of sexuality.
{{% /notation %}}

{{% notation title="On Stemming" %}}

I thought about stemming some of these words (homosexual/ity; sex/ual/ity) to combine counts, but decided that the differences in regional frequencies justified presenting each one separately in the table.

{{% notation title="Representing Sexuality" %}}

I spent considerable time deciding on how to label various topics within the history of sexuality. This table presents lists of terms that make up a topic so that readers could analyze for themselves the content behind each topic label. We called the list “keywords” to avoid confusion over how “most likely words” is the topic produced by  topic modeling.

{{% /notation %}}

**Table 10: Sexuality Topics Within Women's History Abstracts**
|**Topic Label**|**Keywords associated with Topic**|**%**|

|Sexual Regulation| Sexual violence, prostitution, social control, honor, rape, criminal| 2.6%|
|Repoductive Health| Birth, pregnancy, health, disease, abortion| 1.7%|
|Same-Sex Sexuality| Lesbian, gay, homosexual, film, sex, sexual| 1.3%|
|**Total**| | 9%|

Figure 6 shows the regional variations in these sexuality topics within
women's history abstracts. Work related to sexuality makes up the
biggest proportion of Western European abstracts, and the smallest of
Middle Eastern abstracts. Work on same-sex sexual behavior is the
smallest portion of every region's scholarship on sexuality, and also
varies greatly -- from a low of 0.4% in South Asian abstracts to a high
of 1.7% in North American women's history abstracts. Discussion of
sexual regulation was a significant part of all abstracts; in most cases
about twice the focus on reproduction. Overall, even regions with
similar amounts of sexuality scholarship focused on rather different
mixtures of subtopics.

{{% notation title="Chronology, One Last Time" %}}
Here, too, I argued against the
assumption that so-called "trendy" topics like history of sexuality are
necessarily focused only on the modern period.

I found this graphic particularly useful for comparing multiple regions and topical areas. And it displays well in black and white. One oops: Figure 6 says “Homosexuality” while the text and Table 10 refers to same-sex sexual behavior and sexuality. If I were writing this today, I’d likely choose a version of LGBTQ as a topic identifier instead.

{{% /notation %}}

{{< figure src="/img/blocknewmanfig6.png" title="Figure 6:" caption="Regional Variation of Sexuality Topics Within Women's History Abstracts" alt="Bar chart of sexality topics in women's history abstracts by region." >}}

In fact, it appears that there is more clear variation across regional
lines of sexuality topics than across time periods. Table 11 shows that
the most recent and most distant chronological eras studied address
sexuality in near identical amounts (8.5% and 8.6% of each period's
women's history abstracts, respectively), and that there is no linear
pattern of increased work on sexuality as scholarship moves
chronologically forward. Even work on same-sex sexual behavior is more
common c.1450-1599 than at any time except the 20^th^ century. The
(slight) lowpoint of sexuality work appears to be in the eighteenth
century -- perhaps scholars interested in the early expressions of
sexuality pre-date that century, and scholars interested in the rise of
modern sexuality gravitate toward the 19^th^ and 20^th^ centuries.
Overall, such results suggest that despite much more difficult-to-find
sources in earlier centuries, scholars have been publishing on sexuality
across time in roughly similar proportions -- earlier periods are
smaller raw numbers, but reflect roughly similar trans-historic women's
history interest in sexuality studies overall.

{{% notation title="Section Summary" %}}
This section on history of sexuality seemed to
have the least analysis -- I would definitely be less tentative now than
I was when writing this more than a decade ago. I was very focused on
presenting findings in the limited space I had left -- as I likely was
trying to signal with my description of it here as a "brief" case study.
In fact, in one of my responses to the editors, I offered to jettison
this section so I could expand discussion in previous sections, but they
did not prefer that option.
{{% /notation %}}

This brief case study suggests the ways that we might use data mining
technologies to better understand the content of women's history. In
terms of sexuality, specifically, women's historians might consider
focusing more attention on reproduction's relation to sexuality, moving
beyond transgressive (hetero)sexuality, and more fully integrating
same-sex sexuality. The diversity of chronologic interest in sexuality
also reminds scholars to not presume that sexuality scholarship is most
vibrant in recent eras, and might again serve to encourage scholars'
in-depth conversations about sexuality across multiple centuries.

I don’t remember why I didn’t make a bar chart or some other graphic representation for this table. I think that would have been more effective than rows and columns of percentages.

**Conclusion**

{{% notation title="Current Relevance" %}}
It was important to signal the political and
institutional issues at stake in understanding the place of women's
historical publishing in the profession. As a colonial historian who had
"don't be ahistoric, stick to your time period" beaten into my brain, this
was probably the first time I decided to directly tie my work to current
events (I've continued to do this in historical work as the profession
productively moves more to embrace the importance of relevance in all scholarship.).
{{% /notation %}}

In June 2009, the *New York Times* published an article on the decline
of "traditional history" courses, and held women's/gender history
largely accountable for this decline.[^28] The author made these claims
using a very limited (and as some have argued, quite flawed)
quantitative analysis. We counteract this kind of misrepresentation of
women's history as a behemoth threat to the field with our analysis of a
half a million article abstracts to show that women's history is not
even 10% of historical abstracts from 1985-2005. And unlike the *New
York Times* article, topic modeling shows that all of these women's
history abstracts focus on other thematic areas as well -- including
national, political and military histories.

{{% notation title="Activism" %}}
This paragraph comes closest to my own belief -- albeit
too carefully couched -- that activism is a necessary part of
scholarship. This felt radical when I wrote this. It does not now.
{{% /notation %}}

Underlying our work is not only the desire to better understand the
field of women's history, but also to ask where and when women's history
might best benefit from activist efforts. Armed with concrete
information about the progress, gaps, and trends in the field, we can
better identify needs and formulate discrete plans of action. It is one
thing to encourage internationalization of publications, it is another
to ask why a particular regional field seems demonstrably less engaged
with women's history, to directly mentor scholars in those fields for
submission to journals, or to engage leaders in those fields with the
evidence of their field's (in)attention to women's history.

{{% notation title="What To Do" %}}
Here I overviewed general ideas about addressing some
of the discrepancies in publication abstracts such as ways to talk across time
periods, see commonalities, and embrace interdisciplinarity. None of
this strikes me as particularly original or exciting, but I suspect much
of it remains a challenge to effectively undertake.
{{% /notation %}}

Without doubt, women's history, like the profession as a whole, is
focused on more recent time periods. Women's historians could certainly
have more conversations across centuries and be attentive to the ways
that much of the analytic threads running through work being done on
pre-1800 time periods may be broadly applicable to other times and
places. Women's historians' can also continue to find productive ways to
integrate the outstanding non-historical feminist work done in
interdisciplinary-study programs into our chronologically distant
historic studies-- and to encourage interdisciplinary scholars to better
integrate historical work into their own.

{{% notation title="On Collaboration" %}}
We also raised what I think is a more
interesting point: how to actually do interdisciplinary work in digital
humanities, especially at institutions without DH programs.
This remains challenging: in 2021, the kind of data analysis in this
article would not be an interesting computational research project for a
computer scientist. I happened to be in the right place with the right
connections at the dawn of topic modeling, and I saw its potential. That
kind of serendipity is not a strategy for regularized collaboration.

We also endorse the suggestion, in a recent AHA *Perspectives* forum on
New Media histories, that digital advances can change how we can do
history, not just how we present history. Our collaboration between a
women's historian and a computer scientist has allowed us to manipulate
huge quantities of data and apply cutting-edge data mining techniques to
women's history: in other words, not just to access the ever-growing
quantity of digital documents, but to find new ways to analyze
them.[^29]

{{% notation title="Just The Beginning" %}}
We really tried to emphasize that this was
meant to be a case study, a model, a proof of concept. We also
acknowledged that the data took center stage over its comprehensive
thorough analysis because we viewed this piece as a starting point for
discussion. If I hadn't been out of the country and then in full-time
administrative positions when this was being written and published, I
might have organized some panels or symposia to better promote those
kinds of discussions.

This work, however, is just a beginning overview of how we might
investigate women's history's historiography. Although we have presented
a wide array of information about two decades of women's history
abstracts, we have been able to include only rudimentary speculation.
The massive amounts of data -- starting with more than half a million
abstracts -- that we were able to analyze lends itself to almost
unending tables, figures, and data points. We chose broad areas of
analysis based on our own perceptions of women's and sexuality history,
as well as those that spoke to recent historiographic debates in the
field. But there are still countless areas open for investigation.

{{% notation title="Reflection" %}}
In the next two paragraphs, I aimed for honest
reflection on some of the limitations of our work and some ideas for
future exploration. Most notably, I would have loved to data mine full
text of articles. At various points we had preliminary discussions with
the Mellon foundation and an editor at a major journal but nothing
concrete resulted. To be honest, I probably was ready to move on to my
next book project by the time this was completed (Sharon Block,
*Colonial Complexions:* *Race and Bodies in Eighteenth-Century America*
(University of Pennsylvania Press, 2018).
{{% /notation %}}

We could easily incorporate forty or fifty years of abstracts to track
longer-term trends; for example, seeing whether the slowing increase in
women's history abstracts in the new millennium proves to be a temporary
blip. No database is perfect -- in this case, the biggest problem with
AHL and HA is their chronologic starting point at c. 1450. This
limitation means that we have not been able to include ancient and
medieval women's history in our analysis. Moreover, abstracts are a
mediated source that may tell us as much about abstracting patterns as
about actual scholarship: Are foreign language articles
underrepresented? Who are the abstractors, how might their own
perspectives affect the content of the abstract, and to what degree do
changes in language reflect abstractors' shifting *termes d'art* as much
as shifts in scholarly approaches? Analyzing full-text articles would
thus be a logical next step for topic model analysis. Full-text articles
would remove the mediation of abstracts and allow for much more
sophisticated and in-depth analyses of subfields of scholarship.

Future research might also look more at regional variations -- and given
the growing interest in transnational scholarship, might productively
complicate national and regional identities. Likewise, looking in-depth
at specific centuries might help identify the extent to which women's
history is shifting its focus to time periods within particular regions.
Should we expect women's history to map proportionately to overall
regional and chronologic divisions, or can we explicitly account for
women's history choosing its own paths of study, sometimes in contrast
to the field at large?

{{% notation title="Back to Politics" %}}
Upon rereading the next three paragraphs --
which contained some of my strongest political beliefs about higher
education and the historical profession \-- I note that their content is
often couched as questions, the text equivalent of a woman's raised
intonation at the end of a sentence. I am glad that I addressed the
issue of how the institutional treatment of women in higher education
relates to the production of women's history, including the gendering of
adjunctification.
{{% /notation %}}

Such analysis also has the potential to raise political issues. Should
women, as roughly 50% of any given population, expect to be the focus of
half of all historical scholarship? Would this inclusion of women
necessarily make all history partly women's history? More specifically,
what are we to make of the leveling-off of work on women's history in
the late 1990s? Has women's history reached a saturation point, where it
is incorporated into mainstream histories, and thus unremarkable? Has
the shift to cultural history, with its attendant focus on gender and
sub-topics, such as masculinity, moved the focus away from publications
that are classifiable as women's history? Or can we identify a backlash
against women as subjects of study in what some have called a
post-feminist era?

Ultimately, we might ask how women's place in the academy relates to the
expansion of women's history. If women's historians are likely to be
women, how does equity within the profession relate to the future of the
field? Do disproportionate numbers of female adjuncts, who may be less
able to publish under heavy teaching loads, decrease women's history
publications? While somewhat far removed from a direct analysis of
historical scholarship, these kinds of issues form the institutional
background against which scholarship is produced and selected for
publication.

{{% notation title="Final Conclusion" %}}
We conceptualized this essay as a state of the
field that could be used in future studies. I do not think it has been
used that often -- computational scholars are far more likely to cite
our work in *JASIST*, not this women's history publication far outside
their scope of expertise. And women's historians have not seemed to be
as interested in quantitative explorations of the field. Still, after
returning to this essay to write these annotations, I am positively
struck by what we accomplished, and even if it might not have been to
everyone's tastes, we offered both a digital humanities computational
methodological model and a set of conclusions that can inform an array
of future investigations.
{{% /notation %}}

To conclude, our analysis had tried to provide a bird's eye view of
roughly two decades of abstracts in post-c.1450 women's history. Much of
our purpose has been to provide useful data, rather than totalizing
conclusions. We hope students and scholars will be able to use this data
to pursue their own lines of inquiry. Getting a broad sense of where the
field has been, how it has changed, and how it relates to the historical
field in general will allow us all to better formulate informed opinions
about what the next decades of women's history might accomplish.

[^16]: We created the broad chronological categories for our analysis.
    Cross-century categorizations include abstracts that were
    substantially on both centuries (e.g.: we categorized an abstract
    labeled 1799-1850 as "19th century," while an abstract labeled
    1750-1820 we counted as "18th-19th centuries"). We were able to
    identify 18,754 of the women's history abstracts, and 302,909 of
    overall abstracts.

[^17]: Bennett, *History Matters*, 30-53. Again, because AHL and HA do
    not regularly include abstracts on ancient or pre-modern
    scholarship, we only analyze post-c.1450 time periods.

    similarly found content that exclusively focused on women's history
    topics varying from about 2.6% to 3.2%.

[^21]: Beginning in 1995, North American and non-North American
    abstracts each alternatively accounted for between approximately 48%
    and 52% of overall abstracts.

[^22]: To make calculations less convoluted, we simplified chronological
    time periods by splitting cross-century categories equally into each
    of the two centuries they address. Thus, an abstract covering two
    centuries was counted as 0.5 of an abstract in each century it
    covered.

    were grouped into the "Regional Focus" category).

    scholarship on demography, which was far more frequent within
